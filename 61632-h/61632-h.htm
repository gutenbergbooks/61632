<h2>LETTER LIV.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>The Bible.—More mischievous when first
translated than it is at present: still hurtful
to a few, but beneficial to many.—Opinion
that the domestic Use of the Scriptures
would not be injurious in Spain.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">T</span><span class="smc">he</span>
first person who translated the Bible
into English was Wickliffe, the father in
heresy of John Hus, Jerome of Prague,
and the Bohemian rebels, and thus the author
of all the troubles in Germany. His
bones were, by sentence of the Council of
Constance, dug up, and burnt, and the ashes
thrown into a river, near Lutterworth, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
the province of Leicestershire. The river
has never from that time, it is said, flooded
the adjoining meadows: this is capable
of a double construction; and accordingly,
while the heretics say that the
virtue of his relics prevents the mischief,
the catholics on the other hand
affirm that it is owing to the merit of the
execution.</p>

<p>It was translated a second time under
Henry VIII. at the commencement of
the schism, and most of the translators,
for many were engaged, suffered in one
place or another by fire. I would not be
thought, even by implication, to favour
punishments so cruel, which our age,
when zeal is less exasperated and better
informed, has disused; but that the workmen
came to such unhappy end may be
admitted as some presumption that the
work was not good.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span> In fact, the translation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
of the scriptures produced at first
nothing but mischief. Then was fully
exemplified what St Jerome had said so
many centuries ago. <i>Sola scripturarum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
ars est, quam sibi omnes passim judicant.
Hanc garrula anus, hanc delirus senex,
hanc sophista verbosus, hanc universi præsumunt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
lacerant, docent, ante quam discant.</i>
There seemed to be no end to the
multiplication of heresies, and the divisions
and subdivisions of schism. You
remember Feyjoo's story of the English
house which contained within itself
three distinct churches, the whole
family consisting of only father, mother,
and son. Bellarmine relates one equally
curious which he heard from a witness
of the fact. The heretical priest was
reading in his church, as is customary,
a portion of the English Bible, and it
happened to be the twenty-fifth chapter
of Ecclesiasticus. "All wickedness is
but little to the wickedness of a woman.
As the climbing up a sandy way is to the
feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words
to a quiet man.—Of the woman came the
beginning of sin, and through her we all
die.—Give the water no passage; neither
a wicked woman liberty to gad
abroad." One of his female auditors sate
swelling with anger till she could bear no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
more. "Do you call this the word of
God?" said she. "I think it is the word
of the devil." And she knocked down the
Bible and left the church.</p>

<p>But that the free use of a translation
should do mischief at first, and more
especially in those unhappy times, is no
argument against it in the present day.
You have asked me what is its effect at
present. I reply to the question with diffidence,
and you must remember that
what I say is the result of enquiry, not of
observation.</p>

<p>How little the unthinking and ignorant
part of the community understand their
Scriptures, and they are the majority of
every community, you may judge by this
example. The fungus which grows in
circular groups, is believed here to start
up in the place where a diminutive race of
beings dance by night, whom they call
Fairies, and who in many things, particularly
in their mischievous propensities,
seem to resemble our <i>Duendes</i>. A clergyman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
was one day walking with one of
his parishioners over his fields, and the
man observed as he passed one of these
rings, that the fairies were never seen now,
as they used to be in old times.—"What
do you mean by old times?"—"In the
times of the Scriptures."—"Nay," said
the priest, "I am sure you never read of
them in the Scriptures."—"Yes, I do,
and I hear you read of them almost
every Sunday at church."—You may conceive
the priest's astonishment—"Hear
me read of them?" he exclaimed. The
man persisted,—"It is no longer ago than
last Sunday you read about the Scribes and
<i>Pharisees</i>."</p>

<p>There is another class to whom it is
pernicious: these are they who having
zeal without knowledge think themselves
qualified to explain difficult texts, and
meddle with the two-edged sword of theological
controversy. One man, reading
that Christ said, "My Father is greater
than I," without further consideration becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
an Arian; the phrase "Son of
Man" makes another a Socinian; a third
extracts Calvinism out of St Paul.—There
is a sect called Jumpers, who run
out of their conventicles into the streets
and highways, shouting out "Glory!
Glory!" and jumping all the while with
incessant vehemence till their strength
is totally exhausted. If you ask the reason
of this frantic devotion, they quote
Scripture for it!—When Elizabeth heard
the salutation of Mary the most Holy,
the babe leaped in her womb: the lame
man whom Peter and John healed at the
gate of the temple, leaped, and praised
God: and David danced before the Ark!
These fanatics are confined to Wales,
where the people are half savages.</p>

<p>Many of the higher classes live, as you
may suppose, so entirely without God in
the world, that to them it would be of no
consequence if the scriptures existed in
no other language than the original Greek
and Hebrew. But in all ranks of society
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
there are numbers of persons to whom the
perusal of God's own word is an inestimable
comfort. No book of devotion
would so certainly fix their attention; not
only because no other can be regarded with
such reverence, but also because none is
in itself so interesting. It is a pleasure
to them, as well as a consolation; and
probably some important maxim, some
striking example, nay perhaps even some
divine truth, may be thus more deeply
imprest upon the heart than it otherwise
would be, especially in a land where
the priest imparts no domestic instructions,—his
functions being confined to
the church, and the churchyard. In
sickness, in sorrow, and in old age,
in resignation under sufferings inflicted,
or in thankfulness for blessings vouchsafed,
they go to their Bible instead of their
beads, with humble hearts and perfect
faith; fervently feeling all that they understand,
and devoutly believing all that
is above their comprehension. These persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
are schismatics, because they were
born so; if it was not their misfortune,
it would not be their crime; and I hope
I may be permitted to hope, that in
their case the sins of the fathers will not
be visited upon the children. He who
has threatened this has promised also to
show mercy unto thousands in them that
love him,—and England has been fruitful
of saints and martyrs.</p>

<p>Do I then think, from what the domestic
use of the Holy Scriptures produces
in England, that it would be beneficial
in Spain? Speaking with that
diffidence which becomes me, and with
perfect submission to the Holy Church,
I am of opinion that it would. St Jerome
indeed has said, <i>Melius est aliquid
nescire, quam cum periculo discere</i>; and
St Basil has compared the effects of the
Scriptures upon weak minds, to that of
strong meats upon a sickly stomach.
But the days of Julian Hernandez and
Cypriano de Valera are happily over; we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
have an authorised translation, free from
perversion; and were it printed in a
cheaper form, I think much of the good
which it does in England would be produced,
and none of the evil. It might
also have the good effect of supplanting
some of those books of devotion which savour
too much of credulity, and do little
service and less honour to religion. But in
saying this I speak humbly, and with the
most perfect submission to authority.</p>

<p>The English Bible is regarded as one of
the most beautiful specimens of the language,
which indeed it fixed. The privilege
of printing it is restricted to the two universities,
and the king's printer, in order,
I suppose, to preserve the text correct; yet
some impressions once got abroad wherein
the negative in the seventh commandment
had been omitted, and it was said Thou
<i>shalt</i> commit adultery. Means have been
devised of eluding this exclusive privilege,
by printing a commentary with the text;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
and in two magnificent Bibles (the price of
one was above thirty pieces of eight!) this
was so plainly practised as a mere evasion,
that the commentary consisted in a single
line, in every sheet, printed in the smallest
type, and so close to the bottom of the
leaf that it must be pared off in binding.
These books are truly magnificent, and
honourable to the state of arts in the country.
But there is a set of booksellers in
London, whose main business consists in
publishing worthless and catch-penny
works for the ignorant in the country, and
these have always a great folio family Bible—as
they call it—in course of publication,
ornamented with pitiful engravings,
and published periodically, because most
of the deluded people who purchase it
could not afford to pay for it in any other
manner. The cover of one of these numbers
was wrapt round some trifling article
which I bought the other day at a stationer's:
it professed to render the most difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
passages clear and familiar, to rectify
mistranslations, reconcile the doubtful, fix
the wavering, confound the Infidel, establish
the peace and happiness of Christian
families in this world, and secure their
eternal salvation in the next!</p>

D. Manuel and his confessor have forgotten
that this miserable argument, which the catholics
are ready enough to advance when it serves their
purpose, is equally applicable to all their own martyrs,
and to the Apostles themselves. It may not
be amiss to subjoin here the fine account of the
death of one of these men, John Rogers, prebend
of St Paul's, whose martyrdom is thus alleged as a
proof of his having deserved it:</p>

<p class="nodent">"He might have escaped, and had many motives,
as his wife and ten children, his friends in Germany,
where he could not want preferment, &amp;c.
But being once called to answer in Christ's cause,
he would not depart, though to the hazard of his
life: from his own house he was removed by Bonner
to Newgate amongst the thieves and murderers:
he was examined by the Lord Chancellor and
the rest of the Councell, and by them was recommitted
to prison: he was much pressed to recant;
but, stoutly refusing, was first excommunicated
and degraded, and then condemned: after
which he desired that his wife (to whom he had
been married eighteen years, and by whom he
had ten children, and she being a stranger) might
be admitted to come to him whilst he lived: but
Stephen Gardner, then Lord Chancellor, would
by no means suffer it. February the fourth, Anno
Christi 1555, he was warned to prepare for
death before he rose: 'If it be so,' said he, 'I
need not tie my points:' and so he was presently
had away to Bonner to be degraded, of whom he
earnestly requested to be admitted to speake with
his wife, but could not prevail. From thence he was
carried into Smithfield; where scarce being permitted
to speake to the people, he briefly persuaded
them to perseverance in that truth which he
had taught them, which also he was now ready to
seale with his blood: then was a pardon profered
to him, if he would recant, but he utterly refused
it: his wife, with nine small children, and the
tenth sucking at her breast, came to him; but this
sorrowful sight nothing moved him; but in the
flames he washed his hands, and with wonderfull
patience took his death; all the people exceedingly
rejoicing at his constancy, and praising God for it,"—<i>Abel

<h2>LETTER LV.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>Curiosity and Credulity of the English.—The
Wild Indian Woman.—The large
Child.—The wandering Jew.—The
Ethiopian Savage.—The Great High
German Highter-Flighter.—The Learned
Pig.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">M</span><span class="smc">y</span>
morning's walk has supplied me with
two instances of English credulity. Passing
through St George's fields I saw a
sort of tent pitched, at the entrance of
which a fellow stood holding a board in
his hand, on which was painted in large
letters "<i>The Wild Indian Woman</i>."—"What,"
said I to my companion, "do you
catch the savages and show them like wild
beasts? This is worse than even the slave trade!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
"We will go in and see," said he.
Accordingly we paid our sixpence each,
and, to our no small amusement, found
one of the lowest order of the worst kind
of women, her face bedaubed with red and
yellow, her hair stuck with feathers, drest
in cat-skins, and singing some unintelligible
gibberish in the true cracked voice
of vulgar depravity. A few passers-by,
as idle and more ignorant than ourselves,
who had in like manner been taken in,
were gazing at her in astonishment, and
listening open-mouthed to the rogue who
told a long story how she came from the
wilds of America, where the people are
heathen folk and eat one another.—We
had not gone a mile further before another
showman, with a printed paper on his
show-board, invited our attention again—"<i>To
be seen here, the surprising Large
Child</i>." This was a boy who seemed to
be about four years old; and because he
was stupid, and could only articulate a few
words very imperfectly, his parents swore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
he was only of eighteen months—and were
showing him for a prodigy.</p>

<p>A few years ago there was a fellow with
a long beard in London, who professed
himself to be the wandering Jew. He
did not adhere to the legend, which was
of little consequence, as his visitors were
not likely to be better informed than himself,—but
laid claim to higher antiquity
than the Jerusalem shoemaker, and declared
that he had been with Noah in the
ark. Noah, he said, had refused to take
him in; but he got in secretly, and hid
himself among the beasts, which is the
reason why his name is not mentioned in
the Bible; and while he was there the he-goat
had given him a blow on the forehead,
the mark of which was visible to
this day. Some persons asked him which
country he liked best of all that he had
visited in his long peregrinations: he answered
"Spain," as perhaps a man would
have done who had really seen all the
world. But it was remarked as rather extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
that a Jew should prefer the
country of the Inquisition. "God bless
you, sir!" replied the ready rogue, shaking
his head and smiling at the same time,
as if at the error of the observation,—"it
was long before Christianity that I was last
in Spain, and I shall not go there again
till long after it is all over!"</p>

<p>Any thing in England will do for a
show. At one of the provincial fairs
J. saw a shaved monkey exhibited for a
Fairy; and a shaved bear in a check waistcoat
and trowsers sitting in an armed chair
as an Ethiopian savage. The unnatural
position to which the poor animal had
been tortured, and the accursed brutality of
his keeper, a woman, who sate upon his
lap, put her arm round his neck, and called
him husband and sweetheart and kissed
him, made this, he says, the most hideous
and disgusting sight he had ever witnessed.
A fellow at one of these fairs once exhibited
a large dragon-fly through a magnifying
glass, as the Great High German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
Highter-Flighter. But the most extraordinary
distance of witty impudence and
blind curiosity which I have ever heard of,
occurred at Cirencester, in the province of
Gloucestershire, where a man showed for
a penny apiece, the fork which belonged
to the knife with which Margaret Nicholson
attempted to kill the King.</p>

<p>Nothing is too absurd to be believed by
the people in this country. Some time
ago there was a woman who went about
showing herself for money, with a story
that she had been pregnant three years.
There was something extraordinary concerning
this impostor; for the house in
which she lived, which stood upon the
shore in the province, or shire as it is called,
of Sussex, had no other walls or roof than
laths and brown-paper pitched over. It
had stood three years without injury, when
the person who related this to me saw it.
In the last reign<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span> the whole kingdom was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
astonished by a woman who pretended to
breed rabbits, and the king's surgeons were
appointed by the state to examine her.—Many
persons are living who can remember
when the people of London went to
see a man get into a quart bottle. This
trick was practised for a wager, which some
one who knew the world ventured upon
its credulity; but as impudent a one was
played off by a sharper in the city of Bristol
at a later period. He promised to make
himself invisible, collected a company of
spectators, received their money for admittance,
appeared on the stage before them,
and saying, "Now, gentlemen and ladies,
you see me,"—opened a trap-door and
descended, and ran off with his gains.</p>

<p>Any thing that is strange, or that is
called strange, a tall man or a short man,
a Goitre or an Albino, a white negro or
a spotted negro, which may be made at any
time with little difficulty and no pain, a
great ox or a fat pig, no matter what the
wonder be, and no matter how monstrous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
or how disgusting, it will attract crowds
in England. There was a woman born
without arms, who made a good livelihood
by writing and cutting paper with her toes.
One family support themselves by living
in a travelling cart, made in the shape of
the vessel wherein the English boil water
for their tea, the spout of which is the
chimney. The learned pig was in his day
a far greater object of admiration to the
English nation than ever was Sir Isaac
Newton. I met a person once who had
lived next door to the lodgings of this
erudite swine, and in a house so situated
that he could see him at his rehearsals.
He told me he never saw the keeper beat
him; but that, if he did not perform his
lesson well, he used to threaten to take
off his red waistcoat,—for the pig was
proud of his dress. Perhaps even Solomon
himself did not conceive that vanity was
so universal a passion.</p>

<p>Yet from this indiscriminate curiosity
some general good arises. Natural history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
has been considerably improved by the
opportunities afforded of examining rare
animals, which would not have been
brought from remote countries for the
mere purposes of science. Posture-masters
and stone-eaters have demonstrated strange
and anomalous powers in the human body;
and the docility of animals, which has thus
been practised upon for the sake of immediate
gain, may one day be applied to better
and more important purposes. Animals
have no natural fear of man:—the
birds on a desert island are as fearless as
they were in Paradise, and suffer him to
approach till he knocks them on the head.
The power of the Eastern jugglers, who by
a song call forth the serpents from their
holes, is not more wonderful than that
which has been acquired over bees in
England. The horse of the Arab is as
well domesticated, and as affectionately
attached to his master, as the dog of the
European. The cattle from one end of
Africa to the other are under the most perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
obedience to their keeper; a boy will
collect a herd of a thousand by his whistle;
by this easy language they are made to
attack an armed enemy as readily as to
come to their milker; and they have thus
overthrown soldiers who had conquered
the elephants of the East and the cavalry
of Europe. When man shall cease to be
the tyrant of inferior beings, he may truly
become their lord.</p>

<h2>LETTER LVI.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>Newspapers.—Their Mode of falsifying Intelligence.—Puffs.—Advertisements.—Reviews,
and their mischievous Effects.—Magazines.—Novels.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">I</span> <span class="smc">have</span>
adhered strictly to J.'s advice respecting
the literature of this country, and
allowed myself to read nothing but contemporary
publications, and such works as
relate to my objects of immediate enquiry,
most of which were as little known to him
as to myself. He smiles when I bring
home a volume of Quaker history, or Swedenborgian
theology, and says I am come
here to tell him what odd things there are
in England. It is therefore only of that contemporary
and perishable literature which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
affects and shows the character of the nation
that I shall speak.</p>

<p>Of this the newspapers form the most
important branch. They differ in almost
every respect from our diaries, and as much
in appearance as in any thing, being printed
in four columns upon a large folio sheet.
Some are published daily, some twice,
some thrice a-week, some only on Sundays.
Some come out in the morning,
some in the evening; the former are chiefly
for London, and one is regularly laid
upon the breakfast table, wet from the
press. The revenue which they produce
is almost incredibly great. At the commencement
of the American war the price
was twopence. Lord North laid on a tax
of a halfpenny, observing, with his characteristic
good humour, that nobody would
begrudge to pay a halfpenny for the pleasure
of abusing the minister. This succeeded
so well that another was soon imposed,
making the price threepence, which price
Mr Pitt has doubled by repeated duties;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
yet the number printed is at least four-fold
what it was before they were taxed at all.</p>

<p>Of those papers for which there is the
greatest sale, from four to five thousand
are printed. It is not an exaggerated calculation
to suppose that every paper has
five readers, and that there are 250,000
people in England who read the news
every day and converse upon it. In fact,
after the 'How do you do?' and the state
of the weather, the news is the next topic
in order of conversation, and sometimes it
even takes place of cold, heat, rain, or
sunshine. You will judge then that the
newspapers must be a powerful political
engine. The ministry have always the
greater number under their direction, in
which all their measures are defended,
their successes exaggerated, their disasters
concealed or palliated, and the most flattering
prospects constantly held out to the
people. This system was carried to a great
length during the late war. If the numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
of the French who were killed in the ministerial
newspapers were summed up, they
would be found equal to all the males in
the country, capable of bearing arms.
Nor were these manufacturers of good
news contented with slaying their thousands;
in the true style of bombast, they
would sometimes assert that a Republican
army had been not merely cut to pieces,—but
annihilated. On the other hand, the
losses of the English in their continental
expeditions were as studiously diminished.
Truth was indeed always to be got at by
those who looked for it; the papers in
the opposite interest told all which their
opponents concealed, and magnified on
their side to gratify their partisans. The
English have a marvellous faculty of believing
what they wish, and nothing else;
for years and years did they believe that
France was on the brink of ruin; now the
government was to be overthrown for want
of gunpowder, now by famine, now by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
stale of their finances. The Royalists in La
Vendée were a never-failing source of hope.
A constant communication was kept up
with them from some of the little islands
on the coast which are in possession of the
English, from whence they were supplied
with money and arms; and the Republican
commander in the district used to farm
out the privilege of going to dine with the
English governor, and receiving subsidies
from him! Constant disappointment has
as little effect upon an English politician
as upon an alchemist, <i>Quod vult, credit;
quod non vult, non credit</i>; he chuses to be
deceived, not to be told what he does not
wish to hear, and to have all good news magnified,
like the Hidalgo, who put on spectacles
when he ate cherries to make them
seem the finer. A staunch ministerialist
believes every thing which his newspaper
tells him, and takes his information and
his opinions with the utmost confidence
from a paragraph-writer, who is paid for
falsifying the one and misleading the other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
<i>Cephaleonomancy</i>, or the art of divination
by an ass's head, is a species of art magic
which still flourishes in England.</p>

<p>Public events, however, form but a small
part of the English newspapers, and the
miscellaneous contents are truly characteristic
of the freedom and the follies of
this extraordinary people. In the same
paper wherein is to be found a political
essay, perhaps of the boldest character and
profoundest reasoning, you meet with the
annals of the world of fashion; the history
of my lord's dinner and my lady's ball; a
report that the young earl is about to be
married, and that the old countess is leaving
town; you have the history of horse-races,
cock-fights, and boxing-matches—information
that the king has taken a ride,
and the princess an airing; a string of
puns, and a paragraph of scandal. Then
come what are called the puffs; that is to
say, advertisements inserted in an unusual
shape, so that the reader, who would else
have passed them over, is taken by surprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
Thus, for instance, my eye was
caught this morning with something about
the mines of Potosi, beginning a sentence
which ended in the price of lottery tickets.
Puff-writing is one of the strange trades in
London. A gentleman, who had just published
a magnificent work, was called upon
one morning by a person whom he had never
seen before.—"Sir," said the stranger,
"I have taken the liberty of calling on you
in consequence of your publication. A
most magnificent book indeed, sir!—truly
superb!—honourable to the state of arts
in the country, and still more so, sir, to
you!—But, sir, I perceive that you are
not quite well acquainted with the science
of advertising.—Gentlemen, sir, like you,
have not leisure to study these things. I
make it my particular profession, sir.
An advertisement ought always to be in
a taking form,—always; there should be
three different ones to be inserted alternately.
Sir, I shall be happy to have the
honour of serving you,—nothing is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
done without hitting the fancy of the
public.—My terms, sir, are half-a-guinea
for three."</p>

<p>Another professor called upon this
same gentleman; and after he had run
through the whole rosary of compliments,
opened his business to this effect,—That
a work so superb as the one in question
must necessarily have its chief sale among
people of fashion.—"Now, sir," said he,
"I live very much in high life, and have
the best opportunities of promoting its success.
I have done a good deal in this way
for Dr ——. I suppose, sir, you allow
centage?"—It proved that he had done a
great deal for the doctor, for he had received
above a hundred pounds for him, and
by way of centage kept the whole.</p>

<p>The advertisements fill a large part of
the paper, generally two pages, and it is
from these that the main profits both of the
revenue and the proprietors arise. The
expense of advertising is so great, that to
announce a new book in the regular way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
amounts to no less a sum than thirty
pounds. The greater the sale of a newspaper,
the more numerous these become:
this renders the paper less amusing, its
purchasers fall off; the advertisers then
lessen in their turn; and this sort of rising
and falling is always going on. A selection
of these advertisements would form a
curious book, and exhibit much of the
state of England. Sometimes a gentleman
advertises for a wife, sometimes a lady
for a husband. Intrigues are carried on
in them, and assignations made between
A. B. and C. D. Sometimes a line of
cyphers appears. Sometimes Yes, or No,—the
single word and nothing more. At
this very time a gentleman is offering a
thousand pounds to any lady who can
serve him in a delicate affair; a lady has
answered him, they have had their meeting,
she does not suit his purpose, and he
renews the offer of his enormous bribe,
which in all probability is meant as the
price of some enormous villainy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span></p>

<p>Poetry also occasionally appears. I have
copied from one lately an odd epigram,
which plays upon the names of the various
papers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next in importance to the newspapers
are the works of periodical criticism,
which are here called Reviews. Till of
late years there were only two of these,
which, though generally in the interest
of the Dissenters, affected something like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
impartiality. During the late war two
others were set up to exercise a sort of
inquisition over books which were published,
as the publication could not be
prevented; to denounce such as were mischievous,
and to hold up their authors to
public hatred as bad subjects. Such zeal
would be truly useful were it directed by
that wisdom which cannot err; but it is
difficult to say whether the infallible intolerance
of these heretics be sometimes
more worthy of contempt or of indignation.
Of late years it has become impossible
to place any reliance upon the opinions
given by these journals, because their
party spirit now extends to every thing;
whatever be the subject of a book, though
as remote as possible from all topics of
political dissension, it is judged of according
to the politics of the author:—for
instance, one of these journals has pronounced
it to be jacobinical to read Hebrew
without points. There are other
reasons why there is so little fair criticism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
Many, perhaps the majority, of these literary
censors are authors themselves, and
as such in no very high estimation with
the public. Baboons are said to have an
antipathy to men; and these, who are the
baboons of literature, have the same sort
of hatred to those whose superiority they
at once feel and deny. You are not however
to suppose that the general character
of these journals is that of undeserved
severity: they have as many to praise as
to blame, and their commendations are
dealt upon the same principle—or want
of principle—as their censures. England is
but a little country; and the communication
between all its parts is so rapid, the
men of letters are so few, and the circulation
of society brings them all so often to
London, as the heart of the system, that
they are all directly or indirectly known
to each other;—a writer is praised because
he is a friend, or a friend's friend, or he
must be condemned for a similar reason.
For the most part the praise of these critics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
is milk and water, and their censure
sour small-beer.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span> Sometimes indeed they
deal in stronger materials; but then the
oil which Flattery lays on is train-oil, and
it stinks: and the dirt which Malevolence
throws is ordure, and it sticks to her own
fingers.</p>

<p>Such journals, even if they were more
honourably and more honestly conducted,
must from their very nature be productive
rather of evil than of good, both to the
public and to the persons concerned in
them. Many are the readers who do not
know, and few are they who will remember,
when they are perusing a criticism
delivered in the plural language of authority,
that it is but the opinion of one man
upon the work of another. The public
are deceived by this style. This however
is a transitory evil: the effect of the praise
or censure which they can bestow is necessarily
short, and time settles the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
when they are forgotten. A more lasting
mischief is, that they profess to show the
reader that short cut to wisdom and knowledge,
which is the sure road to conceit
and ignorance. Criticism is to a large
class of men what Scandal is to women,—and
women not unfrequently bear their part
in it;—it is indeed Scandal in masquerade.
Upon an opinion picked up from these
journals, upon an extract fairly or unfairly
quoted,—for the reviewers scruple not at
misquotations, at omissions which alter
the meaning, or mispunctuations which
destroy it—you shall hear a whole company
talk as confidently about a book as if
they had read it, and censure it as boldly
as if they had bestowed as much thought
upon the subject as the author himself,
and were qualified, as his peers, to sit in
judgment upon him. The effect which
these journals have produced is,—that as
all who read newspapers are politicians,
so all who read books are critics.</p>

<p>This species of criticism is injurious to
the writer; because, it being understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
that the business of a critic is to pass censure,
he assumes a superiority both of information
and ability, which it is not likely
that he possesses in either; except over
such authors as are too insignificant to
deserve notice, and whom it is cruel to
murder when they are dying. The habit
of searching for faults, by the exposure of
which he is to manifest this superiority,
must inevitably injure such a man's moral
character; he will contemplate his own
powers with increasing complacency, he
will learn to take pleasure in inflicting pain,
he will cease to look for instruction, he
will cease to reverence genius, he will
cease to love truth. Meantime he disguises
both from himself and the public his
injustice to the living, by affecting for
the dead an admiration which it is not
possible he can feel; just as the Arian
persecutors of old worshipped the saints,
while they made martyrs.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest evil which this vile
custom has occasioned is, that by making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
new books one of the most ordinary
topics of conversation, it has made people
neglect all other literature; so that the
public, as they call themselves, deriving
no benefit from the wisdom of their forefathers,
applaud with wonder discoveries
which are pilfered from old authors on
whom they suffer the dust to lie lightly, and
are deluded by sophisms which have been
a hundred times confuted and exposed.</p>

<p>The Magazines are more numerous than
the Reviews, and are more interesting, because
their use is not so temporary, and
men appear in them in their own characters;
it is indeed interesting to see the varieties
of character which they exhibit. The
Monthly and the Gentleman's are the most
popular: the latter has been established
about seventy years, and has thereby acquired
a sort of hereditary rank of which
it is not likely soon to be dispossessed.
The greater part of this odd journal is
filled with antiquarian papers,—and such
papers!—One gentleman sends a drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
of his parish church,—as mean a building
perhaps as can be made of stone and mortar,
which is drawn in a most miserable
manner, and engraved in a way quite
worthy of the subject. With this he
sends all the monumental inscriptions in
the church; this leads to a discussion
concerning the families of the persons
there mentioned, though they never should
have been heard of before out of the limits
of their own parish;—who the son
married,—whether the daughter died single,
and other matter of equal interest and
equal importance. If there be a stone in
the church with half a dozen Gothic letters
legible upon it, and at respectful distances
from each other, he fills up the
gaps by conjecture: a controversy is sure
to follow, which is continued till the opponents
grow angry, cavil at each other's
style, and begin to call names; when the
editor interferes, and requests permission
to close the lists against them. The only
valuable part is a long list of deaths and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
marriages, wherein people look for the
names of their acquaintance, and which
frequently contains such singular facts of
human character and human eccentricity,
that a very curious selection might be
made from it. The Monthly is more miscellaneous
in its contents, and its correspondents
aim at higher marks. Some
discuss morals and metaphysics, others
amuse the world with paradoxes; all sorts
of heretical opinions are started here, agricultural
hints thrown out, and queries
propounded of all kinds, wise and foolish.
The best part is a sort of literary and scientific
newspaper, to which every body
looks with interest. There are many inferior
magazines which circulate in a lower
sphere, and are seldom seen out of it. The
wheat from all these publications should
from time to time be winnowed, and the
chaff thrown away.</p>

<p>Literature is, like every thing else, a
trade in England,—I might almost call it
a manufactory. One main article is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
of Novels;—take the word in its English
sense, and understand it as extending to
four volumes of one continued tale of love.
These are manufactured chiefly for women
and soldier-officers. To the latter they
can do no harm; to the former a great
deal. The histories of chivalry were useful,
because they carried the imagination
into a world of different manners; and
many a man imbibed from them Don
Quixote's high-mindedness and emulation,
without catching his insanity. But these
books represent ordinary and contemporary
manners, and make love the main business
of life, which both sexes at a certain age
are sufficiently disposed to believe it. They
are doubtless the cause of many rash engagements
and unhappy marriages. Nor is
this the only way in which they are mischievous:
as dram-drinkers have no taste
for wine, so they who are accustomed to
these stimulating stories, yawn over a
book of real value. And there is as much
time wasted in talking of them as in reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
them. I have heard a party of ladies
discuss the conduct of the characters in a
new novel, just as if they were real personages
of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>The circulating libraries consume these
publications. In truth, the main demand
for contemporary literature comes from
these libraries, or from private societies
instituted to supply their place, books
being now so inordinately expensive that
they are chiefly purchased as furniture by
the rich. It is not a mere antithesis to say
that they who buy books do not read
them, and that they who read them do
not buy them. I have heard of one gentleman
who gave a bookseller the dimensions
of his shelves, to fit up his library;
and of another, who, giving orders for the
same kind of furniture, just mentioned
that he must have Pope, and Shakespere
and Milton. "And hark'ye," he added,
"if either of those fellows should publish
any thing new, be sure to let me have it,
for I choose to have all their works."</p>

<h2>LETTER LVII.</h2>

<p class="gist center"><i>Account of the Quakers.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">T</span><span class="smc">he</span>
most remarkable sect in this land of
sectaries is unquestionably that of the
Quakers. They wear a peculiar dress,
which is in fashion such as grave people
wore in the time of their founder, and
always of some sober colour. They never
uncover their heads in salutation, nor in
their houses of worship; they have no
form of worship, no order of priests, and
they reject all the Sacraments. In their
meeting-houses they assemble and sit in
silence, unless any one should be disposed
to speak, in which case they suppose him
to be immediately moved by the Spirit;
and any person is permitted to speak,
women as well as men. These, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
are only a few of their peculiarities. They
call the days of the week and the months
according to their numerical order, saying
that their common names are relics of
idolatry. The English, instead of addressing
each other in the second person singular,
use the second plural. This idiom the
Quakers reject as the language of flattery
and falsehood, and adhere to the strict
grammatical form. They will not take an
oath; and such is the opinion of their
moral character, that their affirmation is
admitted in courts of justice to have the
same force. They will not pay tithes;
the priest therefore is obliged to seize their
goods for his due. They will not bear
arms, neither will they be concerned in
any branch of trade or manufactory which
is connected with war, nor in any which
is so dependent upon accident as to partake
of the nature of gaming. They prohibit
cards and other games, music, dancing,
and the theatre. A drunken Quaker is
never seen, nor a criminal one ever brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
to the bar. Their habits of patient and
unhazarding industry ensure success; and
accordingly they are, in proportion to
their numbers, wealthier than any other
set of people. They support their own
poor, and take the lead in every public
charity. What is truly extraordinary is,
that though they seem to have advanced
to the utmost limits of enthusiasm as well
as of heresy, so far from being enthusiastic,
they are proverbially deliberate and
prudent: so far from being sullen and
gloomy, as their prohibitions might induce
you to suppose, they are remarkably cheerful:
they are universally admitted to be
the most respectable sect in England; and
though they have a church without a priesthood,
and a government without a head,
they are perhaps the best organized and
most unanimous society that ever existed.</p>

<p>Were it not for their outrageous and
insufferably heretical opinions, it might
be thought that any government would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
gladly encourage so peaceable, so moral,
and so industrious a people. On the contrary,
though they are at present peculiarly
favoured by the English laws, there was
a time when they were the objects of especial
persecution. I will endeavour briefly
to sketch their history;—it contains some
interesting facts, and may furnish some
important inferences. One of the many
remarkable circumstances belonging to
this remarkable body is, that though they
are now the least literate of all the English
sects, they possess more ample collections
of their own church history than any other
Christian church, or even than any monastic
order. If the acts of the Apostles
had been as fully and faithfully recorded
as the acts of the Quakers, what a world
of controversy and confusion would have
been prevented.</p>

<p>George Fox, their founder, began his
career during the great rebellion. There
never was a time in which it could be
more excusable to go astray. The heretical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
church of England, by attempting to
assimilate itself to the church of Rome, in
a few forms, while it pertinaciously differed
from it in essentials, and by persecuting
those who refused to submit to those
forms, had provoked a resistance which
ended in its own overthrow. It was an
age of ecclesiastical anarchy. Hypocrisy
was the reigning vice; the least sincere
were the most zealous: discordant doctrines
were preached every where, and pious and
humble-minded men, puzzled by this confusion
of errors, knew not which to chuse.
They who in this perplexity stood aloof
from any community were so many, that
they were distinguished by the name of
<i>Seekers</i>. George Fox seems to have possessed
much of the zeal, the simplicity
and tenderness of the seraphic St Francis,
(if I may be allowed to compare a heretic
with so glorious a saint in his human qualities,)—but,
having no better guide to
follow than his own nature, no wonder
that he was misled. His mind ran upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
religious things when he was but a youth,
and he had leisure to think of them in the
solitary employment of keeping sheep.
At length, unable to bear the burthen of
his thoughts, he went to one of the heretical
priests and laid open to him the state
of his mind. The priest's advice was, that
he should take tobacco and sing psalms.</p>

<p>In this uneasy state he abandoned all
other pursuits, and wandered about the
country in search of truth, which at last,
by following wholly the feelings of his
own heart, he thought he had attained.
During his wanderings he met with many
persons of a similar state of uneasiness; and,
being thus emboldened, began to fancy
himself divinely commissioned to call men
to repentance,—a commission which he
and his followers soon thought proper to
put in execution. Their zeal was not at
first accompanied with discretion; they
went into the churches and interrupted
the preachers;—there needed not this imprudence
to provoke men who were already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
sufficiently irritated by their doctrines.
The priests became their cruel enemies,
and often instigated the people to fall upon
them. The heretics even in their churches
used their Bibles to knock down these enthusiasts
with; they were beaten down
with clubs, stoned, and trampled upon,
and some of them lost their lives.</p>

<p>The Presbyterians during their short
tyranny treated them with great rigour,
but their greatest sufferings were after the
restoration of the monarchy. No sooner
had the heretical hierarchy recovered its
power, than it began to persecute the dissenters
with such bitterness as the rancorous
remembrance of its own injuries
excited. Charles willingly permitted this,
because he dreaded the political opinions
of these sectarians; it is probable, too,
that as he had been secretly reconciled to
the true faith, he was not displeased to
see a church which dared not pretend to
be infallible, pursuing measures which
nothing but infallibility can justify, thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
accustoming the people to intolerance,
and weakening heresy: so he protected
the Catholics from the false bishops, and
left the sectarians to their tender mercy.
Other sectarians made use of every artifice
to escape; but it was contrary to the principles
of the Quakers to avail themselves
of any subterfuge; and their dress, language,
and manner made it impossible
for them to pass unnoticed. The prisons
were filled with them; the prisons were
then dreadful places; filth, cold, and wet
brought on diseases which were aggravated
by the uniform brutality of the jailors;
and in this manner numbers were destroyed
by the cowardly cruelty of those
who were ashamed openly to put them to
death.</p>

<p>Erroneous as the principles of these people
are, it was impossible that any men
could lead more blameless lives, and display
more admirable integrity or more
heroical self-devotement. George Fox
was more than once set at liberty on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
bare promise of appearing upon a certain
day to take his trial, no other security
being thought needful;—more than once
opportunities of escaping from prison were
avowedly given him, of which he would
not avail himself; and a pardon from the
king offered him, which he refused to
accept, saying, that to accept a pardon,
would imply that he had committed a
crime which needed it. The usual snare
for them was to tender the oath of supremacy,
a test enacted against the Catholics.
It was in vain that they declared their
full assent to the vile heresy of this oath,
and that they affirmed its substance in
other words; the act of swearing was
insisted upon, and for refusing this their
property was confiscated, and themselves
sentenced to perpetual imprisonment.
No injustice, no cruelty, ever provoked
them to anger; they exhorted their
persecutors, but never reproached them.
Instances often occurred of one man's
offering to suffer confinement for another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
The principle of selfishness seemed to be
extinguished among them. Even the instincts
of resentment and self-defence,
perhaps the most powerful and deeply-rooted
in our nature, they had subdued.
Men who had borne arms and approved
their courage in battle, not only submitted
to insults and blows themselves, but saw
their wives and daughters insulted, beaten,
and trampled upon, without lifting a hand
to protect or revenge them. It was in
vain to block up their meeting-houses;
they met in the open streets, and in open
day, though sure that soldiers would be
there to arrest, and a rabble to assault
them; and when the parents were cast
into prison, the children voluntarily followed
their example, held their meetings
in the like manner, and submitted to the
same sufferings, with the same quiet and
unconquerable endurance.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that these excellent
people (as assuredly they were in every
thing not appertaining to the articles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
their faith), while they were thus persecuted
by their brother heretics, were treated by
the true church with a tenderness which
it has never shown towards any others.
Two female preachers who went to Malta
to promulgate their opinions, were seized
there by the Holy Office and confined,
that they might not pervert others; but
when it was found impossible to reclaim
them, they were set at liberty, and sent
out of the island. A man in his way from
visiting them landed at Gibraltar, which
was then in our possession, and went on
Holy Thursday into the church, while
the priest was celebrating mass; he took
off his cloak and rent it, and appeared in
sackcloth; cried out repentance thrice in
a loud voice, and then returned unmolested
to his ship. One man went to Jerusalem
to bear his testimony against pilgrimages
at the Holy Sepulchre! Several went to
Rome to convert the pope, for whom they
seemed to be particularly concerned;—they
were safely lodged in the Holy Office, permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
to write as many memorials as they
pleased to his holiness and the cardinals;
and when they had said all that they had
to say, they were sent out of Italy. With
this tenderness did the church behave to
them, while in England they were whipt
and imprisoned, and in America put to
death by the Calvinists.</p>

<p>Even the infidels respected them. A
woman left her family in the hope of converting
the Grand Turk:—he received her
in his camp, gave her audience, listened
to her respectfully, and dismissed her with
a safe conduct through his dominions.
A ship, of which the master and the mate
were Quakers, was taken by the Algerines,
who put a party of Moors on board to
carry her into Algiers. The crew thought
themselves strong enough to recover the
vessel, and would have attempted to kill
the Moors; but these men, true to their
principle of not fighting, and not hazarding
human life, refused to assist in regaining
their liberty, except by such means as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
they could conscientiously approve. They
contrived to secure their weapons, and took
possession of the ship. These people
profess also to act up to the Gospel precept
of returning good for evil; and in conformity
to this the master promised the
Moors that they should not be sold as
slaves. They put into Majorca, where
the islanders to their great astonishment
found that the prisoners were not to be
sold: they were proceeding to take them
by force, but these Quakers actually set
the Moors loose from their confinement,
that they might assist in working the ship
out of port and escaping. The rascally
infidels, not in the slightest degree influenced
by this example, attempted twice
or thrice to become masters again, and it
required all the authority and exertions of
the Quakers to prevent their men from
knocking them on the head. At the imminent
risque of being recaptured, they
stood over to the Barbary coast, and landed
their prisoners in their own country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
King Charles was dining in his palace at
Greenwich when the vessel came up, and
news was brought him that a Quaker ship
was just arrived which they had won from
the Algerines without fighting. The king
went himself to see it, and when he had
heard the story, told the Quakers they were
fools for letting the Moors go,—"You
should have brought them to me," he
said. "I thought it better for them,"
replied the quaker, "to be in their own
country."</p>

<p>One of their tenets is, that man, when
truly born again of the Spirit, is restored
to the state of Adam before the fall; an
error which approximates nearer to truth,
than the diabolical heresy of the Calvinists
and Gnostics. It might lead to
a perilous confidence in those who presumed
they had attained to this state; but
it must needs produce the best effect upon
the feelings and lives of such as are aspiring
to it. The doctrine of inspiration is
more dangerous, but the tenet which forbids
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
all violence prevents those evil consequences
which it might else occasion.—The
Quakers were always ready to carry a
message from the Lord, but they never
thought of delivering it upon the point of
a dagger. An individual now and then appeared
in sackcloth, crying Repentance,
in the streets. One man in Ireland went
into a Catholic church, naked above the
waist, and burning brimstone in a chafing-dish,
as a token to the congregation of
what they were to expect unless they
repented of their errors. Such extravagancies
exposed none but themselves to
danger.</p>

<p>They lay claim to miracles; and it is
good proof of the fidelity of their chronicler
that none of these miracles can be
considered as impossible, nor even unlikely.
George Fox came into a house at a time
when they had bound a madwoman, and
were attempting to bleed her. He addressed
her with his wonted gentleness, quieted
her fears, soothed her, persuaded the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
to unbind her, and converted her to his
own opinions. Her phrensy never returned;
it had found its proper channel. A
few of their numerous persecutors came
to untimely ends. One in particular, who
had been active in torturing and putting
them to death in New England, was thrown
from his horse and killed upon the place of
their execution: it was natural and perhaps
not erroneous to ascribe this to divine
vengeance. In the days of their persecution
they often denounced a visitation of
pestilence against London:—a tremendous
plague made its appearance and carried off
100,000 of its inhabitants. As they had
announced it, they naturally thought it
came upon their account. One Thomas
Ibbitt went about the streets of the metropolis
denouncing a judgment by fire. On
the very next day the fire of London broke
out, which consumed thirteen thousand
houses. The effect which this produced
upon the prophet authenticates the story.
So utterly was he astonished at beholding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
the accomplishment of his prediction, that
his character was totally changed; he immediately
conceived himself to be something
more than human, advanced to meet
the conflagration, holding out both his arms
to stay its progress, and would infallibly
in this delirium have rushed into the
flames, if he had not been carried away
by force.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the Quakers ceased
upon the accession of James II., who
would willingly have purchased toleration
for the true faith by granting it to all
others. He favoured them also for the
sake of one of their great leaders, whose
father had been his personal friend. It is
related of this king, whom the English
themselves acknowledge to have been the
best of his family, that when one of this
sect was one day addressing him in the palace,
with his hat on as usual, the king
took off his own; upon which the Quaker
observed that the king need not be uncovered
on his account. "My friend," replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
James, "you don't know the custom
of this place;—only one hat at a time must
be worn here."</p>

<p>That these people should have borne up
against persecution is not wonderful.—There
is a stubborn principle in human
nature, which in a good cause is virtue,
and even in an erroneous one is akin to it.
Indeed without persecution, or at least
without opposition, the enthusiasm of a
sect cannot be kept up,—it is its food
and fuel; and without it, it must starve
and be extinguished. From the time of
their legal recognition the enthusiasm of
the Quakers ceased. No prophecies have
since been uttered by them in the streets,
no testimony borne in sackcloth and ashes;
the Grand Turk has been abandoned to his
misbelief, and the Pope, notwithstanding
their concern for him, given up as irreclaimable.
Yet such is the admirable œconomy
of this extraordinary sect, that they
continue to flourish, if not to spread.</p>

<p>So pure a system of democracy was never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
elsewhere exhibited as that of the internal
government of this society. Each
parish regulates its own affairs in a monthly
meeting, each diocese or district in a
quarterly one, the whole body in a yearly
one, which is held in the metropolis.—Deputies
go from the lesser to the larger
assemblies; but every member of the society,
who can conveniently, is expected
to attend. The women have their meetings
in like manner; the equality of the
sexes in all things being practically acknowledged.
In all other collective bodies the
will of the majority is the law. The Quakers
admit no such principle: among them
nothing is determined upon unless it is the
sense of the whole; and as the good of the
whole is their only possible motive, (for
no member of the society receives any
emolument for discharging any office in
it,) they never fail, whatever difference of
opinion may at first have existed, to become
unanimous.</p>

<p>Their preaching strikes a stranger as ludicrous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
You may conceive what it must
needs be, when the preacher imagines himself
to be the organ of inspiration, and,
instead of thinking what he shall say,
watches for what he believes to be internally
dictated to him. Nothing in fact
can be more incoherent than their discourses,
and their manifest inferiority to
those of any other sect ought to convince
them of the fallacy of the opinion upon
which they proceed. That the admonition
of the spirit, in other words the faculty
of conscience, when it be wisely and
earnestly cultivated, is an infallible guide of
conduct, may and must be admitted; but
that which will make a good man act well,
will not always make him talk wisely. It
is not however the matter of these discourses
which impresses those who are
disposed to be impressed: knowing the
speaker to be seriously affected, they partake
his feelings, and become seriously affected
also. Their history affords a curious
illustration of this. The mother of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
chronicler was a Dutchwoman, who being
moved, as she believed, by the Spirit, came
to preach in England in the days of persecution.
She understood no English, and
therefore delivered herself through an interpreter.
One day it happened that the
interpreter was not at hand when the call
came upon her, and the person who attempted
to translate her meaning found
that he could not understand her. The
congregation, however, called upon her
to proceed, affirming that the religious
feeling which she impressed upon them
could not be stronger if they had understood
her. In the hands of a lying chronicler
this would have been magnified
into a gift of tongues. The story is not
the less valuable, though it may provoke a
smile.</p>

<p>The chief cause which exasperated the
clergy so greatly against them, was their
obstinate refusal to pay tithes, and this is
now operating to diminish the sect. Could
they be content to pay, and salve their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
consciences by protesting against it, all
would go on smoothly; instead of this,
they suffer their goods to be distrained and
sold upon the spot; by which they sustain
a loss themselves, and tempt others to profit
fraudulently at their expense. The consequence
is, that the Quakers have very
generally forsaken the country and taken
up their abode in cities. This is doubly
detrimental to them. Those who remain
in the country are left as insulated families,
and zeal even more than gaiety requires
the stimulus of fellowship. By their laws,
anyone who marries out of the pale of the
society is dismissed from it; but these
families who live apart from their fellows
are likely to fall off on this account for
want of neighbourhood. They who are
collected in cities, are lessened by another
cause. Their principles exclude them
from all professions except that of physic,
in which few only can find employment;
commerce therefore may be considered as
their sole pursuit; their plain and moderate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
habits lessen expense, and their industry
insures success; they grow rich, and their
children desert the society. The children
of the rich find its restraints irksome, and
are converted—not by strong argument,
not by incontrovertible authority, not by
any honourable and worthy sense of duty,
but by the pleasures of the card-table, the
ballroom, and the theatre. But the great
agents in converting young Quakers to the
established Church of England are the tailors.
The whole works of Bellarmine could
not produce such an effect upon them as a
pattern-book of forbidden cloths and buttons.
Nor could any reason be urged to
them so forcible as the propriety of appearing
like other people, and conforming to
the strict orthodoxy of fashion.</p>

<p>Odd as it may seem, this feeling has far
more influence among the men than
among the women of the society. The
women who quit it usually desert for love,
for which there is this good reason, that
the Quakers have too much neglected the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
education of their sons. Women are easily
converted in their youth; they make
amends for this pliancy as they advance
in life, and become the most useful diffusers
of their own faith.</p>

<p>The diminution of the sect is not very
manifest; and it is kept up by proselytes
who silently drop in, for they no longer
seek to make converts, and are even slow
in admitting them. Perhaps these new
members, if they are sufficiently numerous,
may imperceptibly bring them nearer to
the manners of the world in their appearance,
and thus lessen the main cause of
their decline.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">"I</span><span class="smc">f</span>
you would live in health," says the
proverb, "wear the same garment in summer
which you wear in winter." It seems
as if the English had some such fool's
adage, by the little difference there is between
their summer and their winter apparel.
The men, indeed, when they go
abroad put on a great coat, and the women
wear muffs, and fur round the neck; but
all these are laid aside in the house. I no
longer wonder why these people talk so
much of the weather; they live in the
most inconstant of all climates, against
which it is so difficult to take any effectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
precaution, that they have given the matter
up in despair, and take no precautions
at all. Their great poet, Milton, describes
the souls of the condemned as being hurried
from fiery into frozen regions: perhaps
he took the idea from his own feelings
on such a day as this, when, like me, he
was scorched on one side and frost-bitten
on the other; and, not knowing which of
the two torments was the worst, assigned
them to the wicked both in turn. "Why
do you not warm your rooms like the Germans,"
I say to them, "and diffuse the
heat equally on all sides?" "Oh," the reply,
"it is so dismal not to see the fire!"
And so for the sake of seeing the fire, they
are contented to be half starved and half
roasted at the same time, and to have more
women and children burnt to death in one
year than all the heretics who ever suffered
in England in the days when heresy was
thought a crime.</p>

<p>I happened to sleep in the country when
the first snow fell; and in the morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
when I looked out of window every thing
was white, and the snow flakes like feathers
floating and falling with as endless
and ever-varying motions as the dance of
musquitos in a summer evening. And
this mockery of life was the only appearance
of life; and indeed it seemed as if there
could be nothing living in such a world.
The trees were clothed like the earth, every
bough, branch, and spray; except that
side of the bark which had not been exposed
to the wind, nothing was to be seen
but what was perfectly and dazzingly
white; and the evergreens in the garden
were bent beneath the load. White mountains
in the distance can give no idea of
this singular effect. I was equally delighted
with the incrustation upon the inside
of the windows. Nothing which I have
ever seen equals the exquisite beauty of
this frost-work. But when I returned to
London the scene was widely different.—There
the atmosphere is so full of soot from
the earth-coal, that the snow is sullied as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
it falls; men were throwing it from the
top of every house by shovels full, lest it
should soak through the roof;—and when
it began to melt, the streets were more
filthy and miserable than I could have conceived
possible. In wet weather women
wear a clog, which is raised upon an iron
ring about two inches from the ground;
they clatter along the streets like horses.</p>

<p>The cold in this country is intense; and
because it is not quite severe enough to
nip off a man's nose if he puts it out of
doors, they take no precautions against it,
and therefore suffer more than the Germans
or Russians. Nay, the Russian soldiers
who were in England during the late
war died of the cold; they had been accustomed
to their stoves and their furs, for
which regimentals and English barracks
were such bad substitutes, that they sickened
and died off like rotten sheep. Liquids
freeze in the house. My water-bottle
burst last night with a loud report. An
exorcist would have taken it for a signal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
gun of the enemy, and have discharged
a volley of anathemas in return. I was
startled, and could not divine the cause
till day-light explained it.</p>

<p>I happened to go into a pastrycook's
shop one morning, and enquired of the
mistress why she kept her window open
during this severe weather—which I observed
most of the trade did. She told
me, that were she to close it, her receipts
would be lessened forty or fifty shillings a-day;—so
many were the persons who took
up buns or biscuits as they passed by and
threw their pence in, not allowing themselves
time to enter. Was there ever so
indefatigable a people!—I may here mention,
that the first confectioner who ever
carried on the trade in England was a Spaniard,
by name Balthezar Sanchez, who
founded a hospital near London at the close
of the sixteenth century. Some of the
English sweetmeats exceed ours: the currant
and the raspberry, fruits which flourish
in a cold climate, form delicious preserves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
Their iced creams also are richer
than our iced waters; but these northern
people do not understand the management
of southern luxuries; they fill their cellars
with ice instead of snow, though it is procured
with more difficulty and greater
expense, and must be broken to the consistency
of compressed snow before it can
be used.</p>

<p>Just at this time these shops are filled
with large plum-cakes, which are crusted
over with sugar, and ornamented in every
possible way. These are for the festival of
the kings, it being part of an Englishman's
religion to eat plum-cake on this day, and
to have pies at Christmas made of meat
and plums. This is the only way in which
these festivals are celebrated; and if the
children had not an interest in keeping it
up, even this would soon be disused. All
persons say how differently this season
was observed in their fathers' days, and
speak of old ceremonies and old festivities
as things which are obsolete. The cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
is obvious. In large towns the population
is continually shifting; a new settler neither
continues the customs of his own
province in a place where they would be
strange, nor adopts those which he finds,
because they are strange to him, and thus
all local differences are wearing out. In
the country, estates are purchased by new
men, by the manufacturing and mercantile
aristocracy who have no family customs to
keep up, and by planters from the West
Indies, and adventurers from the East, who
have no feeling connected with times and
seasons which they have so long ceased to
observe.</p>

<p>Perhaps no kingdom ever experienced so
great a change in so short a course of years
without some violent state convulsion, as
England has done during the present
reign. I wish I could procure materials to
show the whole contrast:—A metropolis
doubled in extent; taxes quintupled; the
value of money depreciated as rapidly as if
new mines had been discovered; canals cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
from one end of the island to the other;
travelling made so expeditious that the internal
communication is tenfold what it
was; the invention of the steam-engine,
almost as great an epocha as the invention
of printing; the manufacturing system carried
to its utmost point; the spirit of commerce
extended to every thing; an empire
lost in America, and another gained in the
East; these would be parts of the picture.
The alteration extends to the minutest
things, even to the dress and manners of
every rank of society.</p>

<p class="gist"><i>Cards.—Whist.—Treatises upon this Game.—Pope
Joan.—Cards never used on the

English cards are, like the French,
fifty-two in number. They differ from
them in the figured cards, which are
whole-length, and in the clumsiness of
their fabric, being as large again, thick in
proportion, and always plain on the back.
Our names for the suits are retained in
both countries; and as only with us the
names and the figures correspond, and our
words for cards (<i>naypes</i>) is unlike that in
any other European language, we either
invented or first received them from the
Orientals.</p>

<p>Gambling, dancing, and hunting are as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
favourite pastimes among the English as
among savages. The latter of the sports
must of course be almost exclusively the
amusement of men; dancing requires youth,
or at least strength and agility; but old
and young, hale and infirm, can alike enjoy
the stimulus of the dice-box or the
card-table.</p>

<p>Fashion, which for a long time appointed
the games in this country, as it does
every thing else, seems here at last to have
lost its fickleness. Ombre, Basset, and
Quadrille had their day; but Whist is as
much the favourite now as when it was
first introduced. Casino came in from Italy,
like the opera, and won over many females;
but, like the opera, though it became
fashionable it never was fairly naturalized,
and whist still continues peculiarly
the game of the English people. It suits
the taciturnity and thoughtfulness of the
national character; indeed its name is derived
from <i>whish</i>, a word, or rather sound,
which they make when they would enjoin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
silence.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span> Not a word is spoken during
the deal, unless one of the party, happening
to be of irascible temper, should
find fault with his partner—for people of
the politest manners sometimes forget
their politeness and their manners at cards.
The time of dealing, if silence be broken,
is employed in discussing the politics of
the last deal. Whatever the stake may be,
the men usually increase it by betting
with some by-stander upon the issue of
the rubber, the single game, and sometimes
the single deal; and thus the lookers-on
take as much interest in the cards as the
players themselves.</p>

<p>A certain person of the name of Hoyle
wrote a treatise upon the game, about half
a century ago, and laid down all its laws.
These laws, which, like those of the Medes
and the Persians, alter not, are constantly
appealed to. Few books in the language,
or in any language, have been so frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
printed, still fewer so intently studied.
Compendiums have been made of
a pocket-size for the convenience of ready
reference; these are very numerous; the
most esteemed is by Short.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span> But though
these laws are every where received as canonical,
an old Welsh baronet who used
to play cards six days in the week, and
take physic on the seventh, chose some
few years since to set up a heresy of his
own in opposition. It consisted in reducing
the number of points from ten to six,
allowing no honours to be counted, and
determining the trump by drawing a card
from the other pack, so that the dealer
had no advantage, and all chance was as
far as possible precluded. Whether this
was considered as savouring too much of
equality and Jacobinism I know not, but
he made few proselytes, and the schism
expired with him. He himself called it
Rational Whist; his friends, in a word of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
contemptuous fabrication, denominated it
his <i>whimsy-whamsy</i>.</p>

<p>Of the minor games I have only noticed
two as remarkable, the one for its name,
which is Pope Joan; a curious instance of
the mean artifices by which the heretics
still contrive to keep up a belief in this exploded
fable. They call her the curse of
Scotland; so the legend, fabulous as it is, has
been still more falsified. The other game is
called <i>a fear</i>;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span> each person stakes a certain
sum, a card is named, and the pack spread
upon the table; each draws one in succession,
and he who draws the lot loses and
retires: this is repeated till the last survivor
remains with the pool. The pleasure
of the game consists in the <i>fear</i> which each
person feels of seeing the fatal card turned
up by himself, and hence its name.</p>

<p>Their great poet<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span> speaks of an old age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
of cards as the regular and natural destiny
of his countrywomen,—what they all come
to at last. This is one of the effects of
their general irreligion. When I have
seen a palsied old woman nodding over
these Devil's-books, as the puritans call
them, I could not but think how much
better her withered and trembling hands
would be employed in telling a bead-string,
than in sorting clubs and spades; and it
has given me melancholy thoughts, to
think that the human being whom I beheld
there with one foot in the grave, had
probably never a serious thought upon any
other subject. The more rigid dissenters,
and especially the Quakers, proscribe cards
altogether; some of the old church people,
on the contrary, seem to ascribe a sort of
sacredness to this method of amusement,
and think that a Christmas-day cannot be
duly celebrated without it. But a general
and unaccountable prejudice prevails
against the use of them on Sundays. I believe
that half the people of England think
it the very essence of sabbath-breaking.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing is taxed more heavily than cards
and dice, avowedly for the purpose of discouraging
gambling. Yet the lottery is one
of the regular Ways and Means of government;
and as men will gamble, in some
shape or other, it should seem that the wisest
thing a government can do, is to encourage
that mode of gambling which is most advantageous
to itself, and least mischievous
to the people. If cards were lightly taxed,
so as to be sold as cheaply here as they are
in our country, the amusement would, as
with us, descend to the lowest class of society,
and the consumption be increased in
proportion. The revenue would be no loser,
and the people would be benefited, inasmuch
as some little degree of reflection is
necessary to most games; and for those
who now never think at all, it would be
advancing a step in intellect and civilization,
to think at their sports. Besides
this, cards are favourable to habits of domestication,
and the mechanic would not
so often spend his evenings in the
chimney corner of the alehouse, if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
could have this amusement by his own
fire-side.</p>

<p>All the insignia of taxation are conferred
upon the ace of spades, which is girt
with the garter, encircled with laurels, and
surmounted with the crown, the king's
name above, and his motto beneath; but
under all, and over all, and around all, you
read every where "sixpence, additional
duty!" which said sixpences have been
laid on so often, that having no room for
their increase upon the card, they now
ornament the wrapper in which the pack
is sold with stamps. Once in a farm-house
where cards were so seldom used that a
pack lasted half a century, I saw an ace of
spades, plain like the other aces: they told
me it was always made so in former times;
a proof that when it was chosen to bear
these badges of burthensome distinction,
quadrille, or some one of its family, was
the fashionable game.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">T</span><span class="smc">he</span>
commercial system has long been
undermining the distinction of ranks in
society, and introducing a worse distinction
in its stead. Mushrooms are every day
starting up from the dunghill of trade,
nobody knows how, and family pride is
therefore become a common subject of
ridicule in England; the theatres make it
the object of a safe jest, sure to find applause
from the multitude, who are ever
desirous of depreciating what they do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
possess; and authors, who are to themselves,
as one of their own number says,</p>

<p class="center small">"A whole Welsh genealogy alone,"</p>

<p class="nodent">continue to attack as a prejudice a feeling,
which, as philosophers, it is now
time for them to defend. That the new
gentry of the country should join in
this ridicule ought not to be wondered
at. He who has no paternal oaks has
reason to prefer the poplars of his own
planting, and may well like to expatiate
upon the inconvenience of an old family
house, long galleries, huge halls, and
windows which none but the assessor
can count, in his own villa, which is built
to the pattern of the last tax upon light,
and where the stucco upon the walls is
hardly dry. But that the true gentlemen
of England should so readily yield up their
own precedency to vulgar opinion is indeed
extraordinary. Nothing, however, is
now valued for being old. The windows
and the whole front of the mansion must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
be modernized; the old avenues of elms,
which two centuries have just brought to
their full perfection, are sacrificed to a
hatred of uniformity; and the yew hedges,
which have been clipt year after year till
they formed a thick and impenetrable
wall, are levelled and shorn smooth away.
The fashion of the furniture must be
changed; even the old plate must be melted
down, and recast in the newest shape;
and an English Esquire would as soon
walk abroad in his grandfather's wedding
suit, as suffer the family Tree to be seen in
his hall.</p>

<p>This degeneracy of feeling is confined
to the English, and has not yet extended
to the Scotch, or Welsh, or Irish. That
it is not necessarily and unavoidably produced
by commerce seems to be proved
by the instances of Genoa and Venice;
but the commercial spirit was never so universal
in those states as it is in England,
where it extends to every thing, and poisons
every thing:—literature, arts, religion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
government, are alike tainted; it is a <i>lues</i>
which has got into the system of the country,
and is rotting flesh and bone.</p>

<p>In the celestial hierarchy, we are told,
the gradations, though infinite, are imperceptible;
so gradual is the ascent, and so
beautiful and perfect is order in heaven.
Experience shows that something like this
is desirable in civil society; at least, where
the limits of rank are most strongly marked,
there is there the worst tyranny and the
most abject misery, as among the casts of
Hindostan. Towards this evil the English
are tending; the commercial system encroaches
on the one hand upon the aristocracy,
and on the other it treads down the
peasants, and little landholders, the yeomanry
as they were called, who were once
the strength of England. Half a century
ago the country was divided into small
farms; here was a race of men above the
labourers, though labourers themselves;
not superior to their hinds in manners or
education, and living at the same table
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
with them, but still in independence, and
with that feeling of independence which
was the pride of the country, and which
has made the country what it is. These
men have disappeared since agriculture
has become a trading speculation: field
has been joined to field; a moneyed farmer
comes, like Aaron's rod, and swallows up
all within his reach. Agriculture is certainly
materially improved; whether the
markets be better supplied or not is disputed;
there is less competition, and the rich
cultivator can withhold produce which his
poorer predecessor must have brought to
sale. In this point perhaps the advantages
and disadvantages may be equal. But the
evil is, that there is one gradation the less
in society; that the second step in the
ladder is taken away. And this evil is felt
and acknowledged: the race of domestic
servants were formerly the children of
these little farmers; they were decently
and religiously educated; and because they
were of respectable parentage, they possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
a sort of family pride which made
them respectable themselves. But the labouring
and manufacturing poor have no
leisure to breed up their children religiously,
and no means to do it decently, and a
very general depravity of the servants is
complained of.</p>

<p>The gentry of small fortune have also
disappeared. The colonial war bore hard
upon them, but the last has crushed them.
Inheriting what to their forefathers had
been an ample subsistence, they have
found themselves step by step curtailed
of the luxuries and at last of the comforts
of life, without a possibility of helping
themselves. For those who were arrived
at manhood it was too late to enter into
any profession; and to embark what they
possessed in trade was hazarding all, and
putting themselves at the mercy of a partner.
Meantime year after year the price
of every article of necessary consumption
has increased with accelerating rapidity:
education has become more costly, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
the same time more indispensable; and
taxation year after year falls heavier, while
the means of payment become less. In
vain does he whose father has lived in opulence,
and whom the villagers with hereditary
respect still address hat in hand, or bow
to as they pass,—in vain does he put down
the carriage, dismiss the footman, and
block up windows even in the house front.
There is no escape. Wine disappears
from his side-board; there is no longer a
table ready for his friend; the priest is no
longer invited after service;—all will not
do: his boys must out to sea, or seek their
fortune in trade; his girls sink lower, and
become dependants on the rich, or maintain
themselves by the needle, while he
mortgages the land, for immediate subsistence,
deeper and deeper as the burthen
of the times presses heavier and heavier;—and
happy is he if it lasts long enough
to keep him from absolute want before he
sinks into the grave.</p>

<p>While one part of the community is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
thus depressed by the effects of war, and
the commercial system, and the diminished
value of money, they who are in
the lucky scale rise as others sink; and
merchants and bankers and contractors
make their way by wealth even into the
ranks of nobility. James I., whom we
compelled to cut off the head of the Raleigh,
being perpetually at his shifts to
supply the extravagance of his infamous
favourites, invented the title of baronet,
and offered fifty of these titles for sale at a
thousand pounds each,—in those days a
weighty sum. This title has never indeed
since been publicly put up to sale, yet it
is still to be purchased; and as one of the
expedients during the American war, it is
known that the then minister, having no
readier means of rewarding one of his
adherents, gave him the blank patent of
a baronetcy, to make the most of, and fill
up with what name he pleased. It is true
that the title confers no power, the holder
still continuing a commoner; but when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
honorary distinctions are thus disposed of,
they cease to be honourable. Knighthood
is here bestowed indiscriminately upon the
greatest and the meanest occasions: it was
conferred upon Sir Sidney Smith, who
stopt the progress of Bonaparte in Syria
and drove him from Acre; and it is lavished
upon every provincial merchant who
comes up with an address from his native
city to the king upon any subject of public
congratulation. This title, which consists
in affixing Sir to the proper name (a
word equivalent in its common acceptation
to <i>Senor</i>), differs from the baronetcy
in not being hereditary; but, as I have
before said, whoever chooses to pay the
price may entail it upon his children.</p>

<p>The indiscriminate admission to nobility
is a practice which produces the same
mischievous effect upon public opinion.
They must be short-sighted politicians who
do not see that, if they would have nobility
respected, they should reserve it as
the reward of great and signal services;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
that it is monstrous to give the same honours
and privileges to a man because he
has the command of three or four boroughs,
as to Nelson for the battle of the
Nile. This however is not all the evil;
the political system of the country is altered
by it, and the power of the old nobles
gradually transferred to a set of new
men, to an aristocracy of wealth. The
Lords in England form the second power
in the stale, and no law can be enacted till
it has received their approbation. About
a century ago the party in opposition to the
crown was known to be the strongest in
the house of lords, and the queen, knowing
that her measures would else be outvoted,
created twelve new peers, who
turned the scale. This open and undisguised
exertion of the prerogative, to the
actual subversion of the constitution as it
then stood, provoked nothing more than a
sarcasm. When the first of these new
peers gave his vote upon the question, one
of the old nobles addressed himself to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
rest, and said, "I suppose, gentlemen,
you all vote by your foreman," alluding
to their number, which was the same as
that of a common jury. This practice of
granting peerages has been more frequent
during the present reign than at any former
period, not less than three-fifths of
the house of lords having been created,
and the number is every year increased.
But to the old aristocracy of the country
every new creation is a diminution of their
power and weight in the political scale.
This evil will eventually occasion its own
remedy; the lords will become at last too
numerous for one assembly, and sooner
or later some mode of election for seats
must be resorted to for the younger peers,
as is now the case in Scotland.</p>

<p>Agur prayed to the Almighty to give
him neither poverty nor riches, and the
wisest of mankind recorded his prayer for
its wisdom. That which is wisdom for an
individual must be wisdom for a nation,
for wisdom and morality are not variable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
There are too much riches and too much
poverty in England; and were there less
of the one there would be less of the
other. Taxation might be so directed as
to break down the great properties, and
counteract the law of primogeniture.—Without
that law no country can emerge
from barbarism, (unless, as in Peru, no
right of individual property be acknowledged,)
and, in small estates, it seems
advisable that it should always hold good;
but when a nation has attained to that
state of improvement which England has,
the operation of the law is mischievous.
Society has outgrown it. But thus it is
that, retaining institutions after their utility
has ceased, man is crippled on his
march, by fettering, like the Chinese women,
the feet of maturity with the shoes
of childhood.</p>

<p class="gist"><i>Despard's Conspiracy.—Conduct of the Populace
on that Occasion.—War.—The Question
examined whether England is in Danger of a
Revolution.—Ireland.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">A</span> <span class="smc">most</span>
extraordinary conspiracy to kill
the king and to overthrow the government
has been detected. A certain Colonel
Despard and a few soldiers were the only
persons concerned. This man had for
many years been the object of suspicion,
and had at different times been confined
as a dangerous person. Whether his
designs were always treasonable, or whether
he was goaded on by a frantic desire
of revenge for what he had suffered, certain
it is that he corrupted some of the
king's guards to fire at him in his carriage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
from a cannon which always stands by the
palace. If it missed, the others were to
be ready to dispatch him with their
swords. The scheme had spread no further
than this handful of associates; and
they trusted to the general confusion
which it would occasion, and to the temper
of the mob. These facts have been
proved by the testimony of some of the
parties concerned. Despard on his trial
steadily denied them, and laid a not unreasonable
stress upon the absurdity of
the scheme. The jury who pronounced
him guilty unaccountably recommended
him to mercy; he, however, and some of
his accomplices have suffered death. The
rest, it is supposed, will be pardoned.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span>
With such lenity are things conducted in
England. No arrests have followed, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
alarm has been excited; the people are
perfectly satisfied of his guilt, and only say
What a blessing that it did not happen
under Pitt!—Never had a nation a more
perfect confidence in the rectitude of their
minister.</p>

<p>The execution was after the ordinary
manner, with this difference only, that the
criminal after he was dead was beheaded,
and the head held up with this proclamation,
"This is the head of a traitor." He
addressed the people from the scaffold,
solemnly protested that he was innocent,
and that he died a martyr to the zeal with
which he had ever been the friend of their
liberties. If revenge were the rooted passion
of his soul, never was that passion
more strongly exemplified than by this
calm declaration of a dying man, which
was so well calculated to do mischief,—and
had it been under Mr Pitt's administration,
a great part of the nation would
have believed him. What is most extraordinary
is, that the mob applauded him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
while he spoke, took off their hats as if in
respect when he suffered, and hissed the
executioner when he held up his bloody
head. They burnt one of the witnesses
in effigy,—and attended the body to the
grave, as if they had been giving him the
honours of a public funeral.</p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<p>The English are going to war. To the
utter astonishment of every body the king
has informed parliament, that formidable armaments
are fitting out in the French ports,
and that it is necessary to prepare against
them. There is not a syllable of truth in
this, and every body knows it; but every
thing in this country is done by a fiction;
the lawyers have as complete a mythology
of their own as the old poets, and every
trial has as regular a machinery as the
Iliad. That war will be the result is not
doubted, because it is well known that
the ministry are disposed to be at peace.
They have given a decisive proof of this
by prosecuting M. Peltier for a libel upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
the first consul; it is therefore reasonably
supposed, that after a measure so repugnant
as this to English feelings, and to English
notions of the freedom of the press, has
been adopted to gratify the first consul,
nothing but necessity could induce them
to abandon their pacific system.</p>

<p>This sudden turn of political affairs has
greatly raised the reputation of Lord Grenville
and his party. It now appears that
he prophesied as truly of the peace as Mr
Fox did of the war. The curse of Cassandra
lay upon both; and it seems as if the
English, like the Jews of old, always were
to have prophets, and never to believe
them. The peace, however, short as its
duration has been, has been highly beneficial.
The English are no longer a divided
people. They are ready and almost
eager for the commencement of hostilities,
because they are persuaded that war is
unavoidable. The tremendous power of
France seems rather to provoke than alarm
them: volunteers are arming every where;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
and though every man shakes his head
when he hears the taxes talked of, it is
evident that they are ready to part with
half they have, if the national exigencies
call for it.</p>

<p>Still the circumstances which occurred
upon Despard's execution may give the
English government matter for serious
reflection. There is no longer a party in
the country who are desirous of a revolution,
and as eager as they were able to disseminate
the perilous principles of Jacobinism.
Bonaparte has extinguished that
spirit; he has destroyed all their partiality
for the French government, and Mr Addington
has conciliated them to their own.
Never was there a time when the English
were so decidedly Anti-Gallican, those
very persons being the most so who formerly
regarded France with the warmest
hopes. Whence then can have arisen
this disposition in the populace, unless it
be from the weight of taxation which affects
them in the price of every article of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
life,—from a growing suspicion that their
interest and the interest of their rulers
are not the same, and a disposition to try
any change for the chance there is that it
may be for the better?</p>

<p>Two causes, and only two, will rouse a
peasantry to rebellion; intolerable oppression,
or religious zeal either for the right
faith or the wrong; no other motive is
powerful enough. A manufacturing poor
is more easily instigated to revolt. They
have no local attachments; the persons to
whom they look up for support they regard
more with envy than respect, as men who
grow rich by their labour; they know
enough of what is passing in the political
world to think themselves politicians;
they feel the whole burthen of taxation,
which is not the case with the peasant,
because he raises a great part of his own
food: they are aware of their own numbers,
and the moral feelings which in the
peasant are only blunted, are in these
men debauched. A manufacturing populace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
is always ripe for rioting,—the direction
which this fury may take is accidental;
in 1780 it was against the Catholics,
in 1790 against the Dissenters. Governments
who found their prosperity upon
manufactures sleep upon gunpowder.</p>

<p>Do I then think that England is in
danger of revolution? If the manufacturing
system continues to be extended, increasing
as it necessarily does increase the
number, the misery, and the depravity of
the poor, I believe that revolution inevitably
must come, and in its most fearful
shape. But there are causes which delay
the evil, and some which may by an easy
possibility avert it, if government should
aid them.</p>

<p>The spread of Methodism in its various
shapes tends immediately to make its converts
quiet and orderly subjects, though
its ultimate consequences cannot be doubted.
The army may as yet be depended
upon, the volunteers are fully equal to any
service which may be required of them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
and the English people, by which denomination
I mean, as distinguishing them
from the populace, that middle class from
whom an estimate of the national character
is to be formed, have that wonderful
activity and courage, that unless the superiority
of numbers against them were
more than tenfold, they would put out an
insurrection, as they put out a fire. They
are a wonderful people. There is no occasion
to cry out <i>Aqui del Rey!</i> (<i>Here for
the king!</i>) in England. Should one man
draw his knife upon another in the streets,
the passers-by do not shrug up their shoulders
and say, "It is <i>their</i> business," and
pass on, letting murder be committed and
the murderer escape. Every man in England
feels that it is <i>his</i> business both to
prevent a crime, and to deliver up a criminal
to justice.</p>

<p>The people then are the security of England
against the populace; but the tendency
of the present system is to lessen the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
middle class and to increase the lower
ones; and there is also some danger that
the people may become dissatisfied with
their rulers. There is no œconomy in the
administration of public affairs; prodigal
governments must be needy, and needy
ones must be oppressive. The sum paid
in taxation is beyond what any other people
ever paid to the state; the expenditure
of the state is almost incredible—for the
last years of the war it exceeded a million
of English money per week. The peculation
is in proportion to the expenditure.
They are now enquiring into these abuses;
many have been pointed out in the department
of the admiralty, and no person entertains
a doubt but that they exist in every
other department in an equal degree. It
is almost as dangerous to touch these
abuses as to let them continue;—but the
alarm has been given, and upon this
ground any member of parliament, however
little his influence and however despised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
his talents, would, even if he stood
alone, prove a far more formidable opponent
to any ministry, than ever Fox has
been with all the great families of the country,
and all his own mighty powers. Any
member who should boldly and pertinaciously
cry out that the public money was
peculated, bring forward his proofs, and
perseveringly insist upon investigation,
would not long be without supporters.
The people would take up the cause: they
can bear to have their money squandered,
and can even be made to take a pride in
the magnitude of the expenditure, as something
magnificent, but they would not
bear to have it pilfered;—and should they
be convinced that it is pilfered, which
these examinations if they be carried on
must needs convince them of—should
they be provoked so far as to insist upon
having all the ways and windings of corruption
laid open, and all the accounts
well examined before the bills are paid, I
know not what lure would be strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
enough to draw them from the scent; and
their governors would have reason to apprehend
the fate of Actæon.</p>

<p>The causes which may prevent revolution
chiefly arise from France. France expects
to ruin England by its finances, forgetful
with what result that recipe for
ruining an enemy has lately been tried by
England upon herself. The French do
not know this wonderful people. It was
supposed that the existence of the English
government depended upon the bank, and
that the bank would be ruined by an invasion:
the thing was tried; men were
landed in Wales, away ran the Londoners
to the bank to exchange their bills for
cash, and the stock of cash was presently
exhausted. What was the consequence?
Why, when the Londoners found there
was no cash to be had, they began to
consider whether they could not do without
it, mutually agreed to be contented
with paper—and with paper they have been
contented ever since. The bank is infinitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
obliged to France for the experiment,
and no persons suffer by it except the poor
sailors, who, when they receive their pay,
put these bills in their tobacco-boxes, and
spoil them with a wet quid.</p>

<p>It is certain that the English government
must adopt a strict system of œconomy,
thereby effectually preventing revolution by
reform, or that sooner or later a national
bankruptcy must ensue—and to this France
hopes to drive them. But what would be
the effect of national bankruptcy?—not a
revolution. The English have no fits of
insanity: if they saw the evil to be inevitable,
they would immediately begin to
calculate and to compound, and see how
it might be brought about with the least
mischief. Thousands would be ruined;
but they who would be benefited by the
reduction of the taxes would be tens of
thousands; so that the majority would be
satisfied at the time, and government begin
its accounts afresh, strong enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
take credit, if the people were not disposed
to give it. For this fact is apparent from
all history,—that the tendency of all political
changes is ultimately to strengthen the
executive power. Forms may be altered—they
who play for authority may win and
lose as rapidly as other gamesters, and
perhaps at more desperate stakes, but the
uniform result is, that the government becomes
stronger. The National Convention
carried decrees into effect which Louis
XIV. would not have dared to attempt—and
Bonaparte has all the strength of that
convention rendered permanent by military
power. Whatever be the external form,
the effect is the same; the people submit
implicitly to the directions of a single
man, till he has riveted the yoke upon
their necks; or cheerfully obey the more
rigid tyranny of laws, because they conceive
them to be of their own making.—A
government therefore with the forms of
freedom, which could persuade the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
that it had no other object than their good,
would be the strongest in the world. The
Spartans called themselves free, and boasted
of their obedience to institutions which
changed the very nature of man.</p>

<p>In the language of modern politics a ministry
has been considered as synonymous
with government, and government as synonymous
with nation. England made
this error with regard to France, and
France is now making it with regard to
England. Admit that the pressure of taxation
should occasion a national bankruptcy,
and that this in its consequence
should bring about a revolution—England
would be miserable at home; but would
she be less formidable abroad? She would
not have a ship nor a sailor the less; and if
any circumstances were to awaken a military
spirit in the land of the Plantagenets,
France, mighty as she is, might tremble
for her conquests. I do not believe that
the fall of the funds would produce any
violent change in the government; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
whether it did or not, the enemies of England
would do well to remember, that it
would finally strengthen the nation.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, whether at war or at peace,
will endeavour to ruin the commerce of
England. As for what he can do by war,
the English laugh at him. The old saying
of the cat and the adulterer holds equally
true of the smuggler; and a large portion
of the world is out of reach of his armies,
but not out of reach of their merchant-ships.
He will take the surer method of
establishing manufactories at home:—they
smile at this too. Manufactories are not
to be created by edicts; and if they were,
if he could succeed in this, he would do
precisely the best possible thing which
could be done for England in the best possible
way:—first check and then destroy a
system, which there is now nothing to
check, which cannot be suddenly destroyed
without great evil, and which, if it continues
to increase, will more effectually
tend to ruin England than all the might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
and all the machinations of its enemies,
were they ten times more formidable than
they are.</p>

<p>That system certainly threatens the internal
tranquillity, and undermines the
strength of the country. It communicates
just knowledge enough to the populace to
make them dangerous, and it poisons their
morals. The temper of what is called the
mob, that is, of this class of people, has
been manifested at the death of Despard,
and there is no reason to suppose that it
is not the same in all other great towns
as in London. It will be well for England
when her cities shall decrease, and
her villages multiply and grow; when there
shall be fewer streets and more cottages.
The tendency of the present system is to
convert the peasantry into poor; her policy
should be to reverse this, and to convert
the poor into peasantry, to increase
them, and to enlighten them; for their
numbers are the strength, and their knowledge
is the security of states.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span></p>

<p>Ireland is the vulnerable part of the
British empire: and till that empire be restored
to the true faith, it will always be
vulnerable there. Another conspiracy has
just been formed there; the plan was to
seize the seat of government, and if the
insurgents had not stopped to perpetrate a
useless murder upon the way, they would
in all likelihood have succeeded; the mails
would that night have scattered their proclamations
over the whole island, and
nine-tenths of the population would have
been instantly in rebellion. The exemplary
attachment of the Irish to the religion
of their fathers is beyond all praise,
and almost beyond all example. Nothing
but the complete re-establishment of that
religion can ever conciliate them to the
English government, or reclaim them from
their present savage state, and the false
hierarchy is too well aware of the consequences
ever to consent to this. Dagon
knows what would happen if the Ark of
Truth were to be set up so near.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Account of Swedenborgianism.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">I</span> <span class="smc">found</span>
my way one Sunday to the New
Jerusalem, or Swedenborgian chapel. It
is singularly handsome, and its gallery
fitted up like boxes at a theatre. Few or
none of the congregation belonged to the
lower classes, they seemed to be chiefly
respectable tradesmen. The service was
decorous, and the singing remarkably
good: but I have never in any other heretical
meeting heard heresy so loudly insisted
upon. Christ in his <i>divine</i>, or in
his <i>glorified human</i>, was repeatedly addressed
as the only God; and the preacher
laboured to show that the profane were
those who worshipped three Gods, and
that their prayers, instead of a sweet-smelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
savour ascending to the throne of
God, were an obscene stink which offended
his nostrils.</p>

<p>This is little remarkable in the civil, or,
as his disciples would call it, the human
and terrestrial part of Emanuel Swedenborg's
history. He was born in 1689, at
Stockholm, and was son of the bishop of
Ostrogothia. Charles XII. favoured him;
Queen Ulrica ennobled him, dignifying
his name by elongation, as if in the patriarchal
fashion, from Swedberg to Swedenborg.
It is certain that he was a man
of science, having been assessor of the
Metallic College, and having published a
<i>Regnum Minerale</i> in three volumes folio;
but he abandoned the mineral kingdom for
a spiritual world of his own, the most extraordinary
that ever a crazy imagination
created.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span></p>

<p>His celestial history is more out of the
common. I am copying from the books
of his believers when I tell you—that his
interiors were opened by the Lord; that he
conversed with the dead, and with the very
worst devils without danger; that he spoke
the angelic language, and respired the angels'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
atmosphere; that for twenty-six years
he was in the spirit, and at the same time
in the body; that he could let his spirit
into the body or out of the body at pleasure;
that he had been in all the planets,
and in all the heavens, and had even descended
into hell; that the twelve apostles
used to visit him; that a conspiracy of
spirits was formed against him; and that
he was seized with a deadly disease in consequence
of a pestilential smoke which issued
from Sodom and Egypt in the spiritual
world.</p>

<p>Enough of this. Let me try if it be
possible to make his mythology intelligible,
and to draw out a map of his extra-mundane
discoveries.</p>

<p><i>Omnia quæ in cœlis, sunt in terris, terrestri
modo; omnia quæ in terris, sunt in
cœlis, cœlesti modo.</i> All things which
are in heaven are upon earth, after an
earthly manner; all things which are upon
earth are in heaven, after a heavenly manner.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
So says Trismegistos, and who
will dispute the authority of the thrice-greatest
Hermes?—The Scriptures therefore
cannot be understood without the
science of correspondences; a knowledge
which the patriarchs possessed intuitively
in the golden age, which was preserved
only scientifically in the silver age, became
merely speculative in the copper age, and
in our iron generation has been wholly lost.
The Egyptian hieroglyphics are to be explained
by this key, which opens also all
the mysteries of the ritual law. Job was
the last writer who possessed it, till it was
revealed to the Swedish teacher.</p>

<p>There is nothing new in this, you tell
me; it is the old notion of a double meaning,
the external and the internal, the literal
and the allegorical, the letter and the
spirit. Not so, my good Father! "Correspondence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
is the appearance of the internal
in the external, and its representation
therein; there is a correspondence between
all things in heaven and all things
in man; without correspondence with the
spiritual world nothing whatever could exist
or subsist." You are growing impatient!—I
must give you a specimen of common
language interpreted by this science. Two
legs stand for the will of God; by a small
piece of the ear we are to understand the
will of truth; the son of a she-ass denotes
rational truth; and an ass, without any
mention of his pedigree, signifies the scientific
principle—certainly no ill-chosen emblem
of such principles and such science
as this. This is stark nonsense, you say!
My good father Antonio; "No distinct
idea can be had of correspondence without
a previous knowledge concerning heaven as
the Great Man," or <i>Maximus Homo</i>, as we
must call him, in the Master's own words.</p>

<p>In sober serious explanation, Swedenborg
seems to have thought upon one text
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
and dreamt upon it, till he mistook his
dreams and his delirium for revelation.
"Let us make man in our image, after
our likeness.—So God created man in his
own image, in the image of God created
he him." His system is a wild comment
upon this passage, as monstrous as any of
the Rabinical reveries. Accordingly he
lays it down as an axiom, that the whole
of divine order was imaged in man at the
creation, insomuch that he was divine
order itself in a human form, and so
Heaven in epitome. Upon this he has
built up a creed of the strangest anthropomorphism,
teaching that the divinity of
the deity constitutes heaven, and that
heaven itself is in a human form, Deity
and heaven thus identified being the <i>Maximus
Homo</i>, the Grand or Divine Man.</p>

<p>It has been one of the many fancies of
hypothetical philosophers, that all bodies
are aggregates of living atoms. Admit
this notion, and it explains all the mysterious
operations of life with perfect facility;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
the little inhabitants of the secretory
organs take each what they like best, and
thus manufacture all the animal materials.
This is analogous to the celestial system
of Swedenborg, but with this difference,
that each constituent part and particle
of his <i>Maximus Homo</i> resembles the whole
in form, every society in this body corporate,
and every individual of each society
being in the human shape divine.</p>

<p>Heaven is to be considered under the
threefold distinction of general, special,
and particular—for Swedenborg had learnt
to classify in his earthly studies. Generally
it is divided into two kingdoms, celestial
and spiritual; but I am sorry to add
that, though I have studied the anatomy
of the Grand Man with some attention, I
cannot discover where or how these regions
are separated. The specific division into
three heavens is more intelligible; the first
is in the extremities, the second or middle
in the trunk, the third and highest in the
head. The particular division is into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
societies of angels, who form the constituent
monads of this divine aggregate.</p>

<p>Every part, however, of the <i>Maximus
Homo</i> is not Heaven; at least the inhabitants
of every part are neither possessed of
celestial goodness, nor in that state of celestial
enjoyment which seems essential to
our ideas of paradise. For instance, the
parishioners of the kidneys, the ureters,
and the bladder, consist of such persons as
in their mortal state took a cruel delight in
bringing others to justice; these people
speak with a harsh chattering voice, like
magpies whose tongues have been slit.
They who have despised virtue and religion
are in the gall-bladder, a bitter destination
no doubt! They also who dwell about the
<i>sphincter vesicæ</i>, amuse themselves by tormenting
the evil spirits. Whether they
are purged of this malignant disposition by
the secretions and excretions which are
going on in their vicinity, this new Emanuel
sayeth not. A purgatory indeed there
is, and a truly curious one! They who are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
still unclean in thoughts and affections are
stationed in the colon; not as component
parts of the Grand Man—of that honour
they are not yet worthy; they are there as
his aliment, to be concocted and digested,
and after the gross fæces have been cast
out, filtered through lacteals and arteries
into chyle and blood, till they are taken up
into the system and embodied. They who
are defiled with earthly dregs are in the
small-guts; the most impure of all in the
neck of the bladder and in the rectum,
both which have below them a most dreadful
and filthy hell, ready to receive their
contents,</p>

<p>This <span title="Ouranos">Ουρανος</span>, or <i>Maximus Homo</i>, seems
to be the body of Deity; and the Divine
Life or Spirit, like the gifted spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
Swedenborg himself, can be in or out, separate
from, or identified with it, at pleasure.
Accordingly, though the angels are
in him, and actually are he, yet they visibly
behold him, as the sun of their world.
Now the Lord in person being the sun,
the light and heat which proceed from
him must necessarily partake of divinity;
accordingly light in Heaven is divine truth,
and heat is divine love: a thin and transparent
vapour, which surrounds the angels
like an atmosphere, enables them to sustain
this influx of Deity. An atmosphere
of this kind, which is called the Sphere of
Life, exhales from every man, spirit and
angel; it is the emanation of the vital
affections and thoughts. In Heaven, of
course, it is volatile essence of love, and
each angel is sensibly affected when he gets
within the sphere of another. We on
earth feel the same influence, though unconscious
of the cause, for this hypothesis
physically accounts for the sympathies of
dislike and of affection.—The Deity is also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
the celestial moon, and this sun and
moon are seen at the same time, one before
the right eye, and the other before
the left. Let an angel turn his face which
way he will, this sun is always before him,
and he always fronts the east; yet at the
same time he can see the other quarters by
an inward kind of vision, like that of
thought. A precious olla podrida this of
allegorical riddles and downright nonsense!</p>

<p>The œconomy of the angels is more rationally
imagined, and is better suited to
our worldly habits, or suited to better
worldly habits than Elysium, or Valhalla,
or the Sorgon, the Paradise of Mohammed,
or the ever-blessed state of Nireupan
to which the Yogue approximates when he
has looked at nothing for seven years but
the tip of his own nose. You are not to
conceive of angels as of disembodied spirits;
they are material beings, though of a
finer matter. They wear garments white,
or flame-coloured, or shining, with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
they are supplied by the Deity; only the
angels of the third Heaven, being in the
state of innocence made perfect, are naked.
They dwell in houses, which are arranged
in streets and squares, like our cities on
earth; but every thing there is on a nobler
scale, and of more magnificence. Swedenborg
frequently walked through these
cities, and visited the inhabitants; he saw
palaces there, the roofs of which glittered
as if with pure gold, and the floors as if
with precious stones: the gardens are on
the south side, where trees with leaves like
silver produce fruits resembling gold, and
the flowers are so arranged as by their colours
to represent rainbows.—There is no
space in Heaven, or, more accurately
speaking, no such thing as distance:
where angels wish to be, there they are;
locomotion is accomplished by the mere
act of volition; and, what is better still,
if one angel earnestly desires the company
of another, the wish attracts him, and he
immediately appears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span></p>

<p>There is a room in the southern quarter
of the spiritual world the walls of which
shine like gold; and in this room is a table,
and on this table lies the Bible, set
with jewels. Whenever this book is opened
a light of inexpressible brilliancy flows
from it, and the jewels send forth rays
which arch it over with a rainbow. When
an angel of the third Heaven comes and
opens it, the ground of this rainbow appears
crimson; to one from the second
Heaven it is blue; to one of the first or
lowest Heaven the light is variegated and
veined like marble. But if one approaches
who has ever falsified the word, the brightness
disappears, and the book itself seems
covered with blood, and warns him to depart,
lest he suffer for his presumption.</p>

<p>There is public worship in Heaven,
which Swedenborg attended, and heard
sermons: they have books both written
and printed; he was able to read them,
but could seldom, he says, pick out any
meaning; from which I conclude that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
has successfully copied their style. Writing
flows from the thoughts of the angels,
or with their thoughts, appearing so coinstantaneously
as if thought cast itself upon
the paper; but as this writing is not permanent,
it seems that pen and ink might
usefully be introduced among them. The
language of Heaven is like the writing,
connate with thought, being indeed nothing
more than thinking audibly. Its
construction is curiously explained; the
vowels express the affections; the consonants
the particular ideas derived from the
affections, and the words the whole sense
of the matter. The angelic alphabet resembles
the Chinese, for every letter signifies
a complete thing,—which is the reason
why the hundred and nineteenth psalm
is alphabetically divided;—and every letter,
and every flexure and curvature of
every letter, contains some secret of wisdom.
Different dialects of this language
are spoken in the celestial and spiritual
kingdoms; the celestials chiefly using the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
vowels U and O, the spirituals preferring
E and I; the speech of the former resembles
a smooth flowing water, that of the
latter the sound of a running stream broken
on its way. But the most enviable power
connected with expression which the angels
possess, is, that they represent their
ideas in a thin undulating circumfluent
fluid or ether, so that they can make
thought visible.</p>

<p>In like manner as our human form goes
on with us to our heavenly state, so also
will our human affections. The ruling
passion, whatever it be, not only lasts till
death, but continues after death. Woe
therefore to those whose whole aspirations
are after things that are earthly, for they
cannot enter the kingdom of Heaven!
This truth is neither the less true, nor the
less important, because it is found in the
pages of a madman. Marriage also is not
dissolved by death:—when one of the wedded
couple dies, the spirit of the deceased
cohabits with the spirit of the living spouse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
till that also be released; they then meet
again, and reunite with a tenderer and
more perfect union. On no subject does
Swedenborg dilate with more pleasure than
upon this. The sphere of conjugal love,
he tells us, is that which flows from the
Creator into all things; from the Creator
it is received by the female, and transferred
through her to the male. It makes man
more and more man; it is a progressive
union of minds, for ever rejuvenescent,
continuing to old age and to eternity; it is
the foundation and germ of all spiritual
and all celestial love; it is in Heaven, and
it is Heaven, yea even the inmost Heaven,
the Heaven of Heavens. It dwells in the
supreme region of the Mind, in the conclave
of the Will, amidst the perceptions of
Wisdom, in the marriage chamber of the
Understanding. Its origin is from the divine
nuptials of Goodness and Truth, consequently
from the Lord himself. After
this it is ridiculous enough to see him trace
the progress of this sphere or essence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
love into the soul of man, thence into the
mind, thence into the interior affections,
from whence it finds its way through the
breast into the genital region.</p>

<p>Do not, however, suppose that there are
any births in Heaven. All spirits both in
Heaven and Hell were born on earth;
from which, it seems, a puzzling argument
against the system itself might be brought:
<i>Ex nihilo nihil fit</i>—Of nothing nothing is
made; where then was the Grand Man
before all the parts of which he is composed
were in existence?—Heaven is supplied
with children by those who die in infancy;
happy are they, for they are given
to virgins whose maternal feelings find in
them an object, and under their tuition
they grow up in the gardens of Paradise.
They advance to the full bloom of youth,
not beyond it; the old, who arrive in
Heaven with all the marks of age, grow
younger till they also arrive at the same
perfection: to grow old in Heaven is to
increase in beauty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span></p>

<p>There are many mansions in Heaven,
and infinite degrees of happiness, yet is
there no envy nor discontent; every one is
happy to the utmost measure of his capacity;
the joys of a higher state would be
no joys to him: his cup is full. But the
longer he has been in Heaven, the happier
he becomes, his capacity of enjoyment increasing
as he is progressive in virtue and
goodness, that is, in divine love.</p>

<p>As all Heaven is one Grand Man, or Divinity,
so is all Hell one Grand Devil, and
the wicked are literally to become members
of Satan. The road from one to the other
is through the <i>Maximus Homo's</i> Port Esquiline;
it opens immediately into the
mouth of Hell, and the two-and-thirty
white millers who sit in the gateway, receive
all they have to grind through that
channel.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span> Hell fire is no torment to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
damned: it imparts no other sensation to
them than an irascible heat; for in truth
the fire of Hell is nothing more than their
evil passions, which appear to good spirits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
in flame and smoke. This is the only light
they have, proceeding from themselves,
and resembling that which is given out by
red-hot coals. The Hell of Swedenborg
is what earth would be if all virtue were
destroyed, if the salt of the earth were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
taken away, and its corruptions left to putrefy.
There are cities inhabited only by
the profligate, where they are abandoned to
their own vices, and to the inevitable miseries
which those vices produce. They
have even their places of public amusement;
he saw the dragons holding their
abominable diversions in an amphitheatre.
Deserts, fields laid waste, and houses and
towns in ruins which have been destroyed
by fire, fill up the picture.</p>

<p>Of all the heretics who have sprung
from the spawn of Luther, Swedenborg is
the only one who admits a purgatory.—You
will not expect a rational one;—in
this intermediate world, as the good are
purified from their imperfections, so are
the wicked divested of what little goodness
they may possess, and thus the one are
fitted for Heaven, and the other for Hell.
The state of maturity for Heaven is known
by the appearance of the regenerate, which
is not altogether consistent with our earthly
ideas of beauty, for the cuticle appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
like a fine lace-work of bright blue. Here
the wicked follow their accustomed vices,
till, after they have been repeatedly warned
in vain, their cities are shaken with earthquakes,
the foundations yawn under them,
they sink into the gulf, and there grope
their way into their respective Hells.</p>

<p>Hypocrites who still preserved an exterior
of piety were permitted to remain in
the intermediate world, and make to
themselves fixed habitations. This constitutes
one of the wildest and absurdest
parts of all this strange mythology; for
Swedenborg teaches that these residents,
by the abuse of correspondences and help
of phantasies, built Heavens for themselves,
which became at last so many and
so extensive, that they intercepted the spiritual
light and heat, that is, divine love,
in their way from Heaven to Earth. At
length this eclipse became total; there was
no faith in the Christian church, because
there was no charity, and the Last Judgment
was then executed; which consisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
in destroying these imaginary Heavens,
like the tower of Babel, stripping the hypocrites
of their cloak, and casting them
into Hell. This consummation took place
in the year of our Lord 1757; and there is
no other Last Judgment to come, except
what every individual will experience for
himself singly, after death.</p>

<p>Nothing now remains but to apply the
science of correspondences to this scheme
of the <i>Maximus Homo</i> and the Grand Satan.
Spirits act upon men in those parts
which correspond to their own anatomical
situation: thus impulses and affections
of good come from the agency of good
angels operating by influx on their corresponding
region, whether head or foot,
heart, pancreas, or spleen; they, for instance,
who inhabit the brain watch over
us when we sleep. On the contrary, diseases
are the work of the devils; hypocritical
devils occasion belly-ache; and spirits
who are ripening for Hell, and take delight
in putridity, get into our insides and manufacture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
for us indigestion, hypochondriasis,
and dyspepsy; so that in all cases
exorcism must be more applicable than
medicine.</p>

<p>One word more:—they who have loved
infants with most tenderness are in the
province of the neck of the uterus and of
the ovaries. By some unaccountable oversight
the inference has been overlooked.
There is therefore a Grand Woman also!
It is not good for man to be alone, not even
for the Grand Man. I have found a wife
for him! The discovery, for it is a discovery,
is at least equal in importance to any
in the eight quarto volumes of the Arcana
Cœlestia, and entitles me to be ranked
with Swedenborg himself; if, indeed, as
I modestly beg leave to hint, the honour
of having perfected his discoveries and
finished his system, be not fairly my
due.<span class="fnanchor"><a

The author seems to have looked for no other
account of Swedenborg than what his ignorant believers
could furnish. At the age of twenty he published
a collection of Latin poems under the title
of <i>Ludus Heliconius, sive Carmina Miscellanea quæ
variis in locis cecinit, &amp;c.</i> Charles XII. valued him
for his scientific knowledge, and profited by it. He
took him with him to the siege of Frederickshall;
the roads were impassable for artillery, and Swedenborg
made a canal, cutting through mountains
and raising valleys, by which his battering pieces
were conveyed. He was a great favourite with
Charles, and deservedly so; for it is said that no
person, except Linnæus, ever did so much in so
short a time. In all the North of Europe he was
held in the highest estimation, till, in the year 1743,
he abandoned science to print his waking dreams,
and become the founder of a new church.</p>

the Three Heavens, and also to Men on Earth.</p>

<p class="nodent">I believe that evil Actions ought not to be done,
because they are of the Devil, and from the Devil.</p>

<p class="nodent">I believe that good actions ought to be done, because
they are of God, and from God; and that
they should be done by Man, as of himself; nevertheless
under this Acknowledgment and Belief, that
they are from the Lord, operating in him and by
him.</p>

<p class="nodent">I believe, that immediately on the Death of the
material Body (which will never be reassumed,)
Man rises again as to his spiritual or substantial
Body, wherein he existeth in a perfect Human
Form; and thus that Death is only a Continuation
of Life.</p>

<p class="nodent">I believe that the Last Judgment is accomplished
in the Spiritual World, and that the former Heaven
and the former Earth, or the Old Church, are passed
away, and that all Things are become New.</p>

<p class="nodent">I believe that now is the Second Advent of the
Lord, which is a coming, not in person, but in the
Power and Glory of the spiritual Sense of his holy
Word, which is Himself. And I believe that the
Holy City, New Jerusalem, is now descending from
God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned
for her Husband.</p>

<p class="nodent">Their Pater-noster is of more curious complexion.</p>

<p class="nodent">Father of us, who in the Heavens; let be sanctified
the Name of Thee. Let come the Kingdom of
Thee. Let be done the Will of Thee, as in Heaven,
and upon the Earth. The Bread of us the daily
give to us this Day. And remit to us the Debts of
us, as and we remit to the Debtors of us. And not
bring us into Temptation, but keep us from the Evil.
Because of Thee is the Kingdom and the Power and
the Glory into the Ages. Amen.</p>

<p class="nodent">This, they say, is perhaps too literal to be used
in public worship <i>as yet</i>. It will, however, serve to
give the English reader an idea of the idiom of that
language which the Lord made use of, when he was
pleased to teach us how to pray. And it may also,
by the arrangement of the words themselves, in
some measure point out the order of influx from the
Fountain of all Life; for the first word in this divine
prayer, viz. <i>Father</i>, is the Universal that flows into
and fills all the succeeding parts, just as the soul
flows into, and fills every part of the human body
derived from it.</p>

<h2>LETTER LXIII.</h2>

<p class="center gist"><i>Jews in England.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">I</span> <span class="smc">went</span>
yesterday evening to the Synagogue.
Never did I see a place of worship
in which there was so little appearance
of devotion. The women were in a
gallery by themselves, the men sate below,
keeping their hats on, as they would have
done in the street. During the service
they took from behind their altar, if that
word may be thus applied without profanation,
certain silver—utensils they cannot
be called, as they appeared to be of no possible
use,—silver ornaments rather, hung
with small rattle bells, and these they
jingled as they carried them round the
room, then replaced them in the receptacle.
This was the only ceremony. It is impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
to describe the strange and uncouth
tone in which the priest sung out a portion
of the Pentateuch from a long roll.
The language was so intolerably harsh,
and the manner in which it was chaunted
so abominably discordant, that they suited
each other to a miracle; and the larynx of
the Rabbi seemed to have been made expressly
to give both their full effect.</p>

<p>In former times the toleration of the
Jews gave occasion to the same disturbances
here as in the rest of Europe. They
cheated the people, and the people in return
took advantage of every tumult to
plunder them. The famous King John,
who offered to turn Mohammedan if the
Miramamolin would assist him against
his rebellious subjects, extorted a large sum
from a Jew of Bristol by a new and ingenious
kind of torture: he condemned him
to have a tooth drawn every day till he
consented to lend the money; and the Jew
parted with six grinders before he submitted.
After the schism, as the Heretics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
began first to persecute the Catholics, and
then one another, the misbelievers were
forgotten. Cromwell even favoured them;
in one respect he differed from all his contemporary
fanatics, for he willingly allowed
to other sects the toleration which he
claimed for his own. Under his protection
Manasses Ben Israel printed three
editions of the Bible in Hebrew. This
Rabbi is generally supposed to have been
a Spaniard, but the Portugueze claim him,
and I think we shall not be disposed to
contend with them for the honour,—especially
as most persons would decide in
their favour, without examination.</p>

<p>During the last reign an attempt was
made to naturalize them, in a body; and
the measure would have been effected had
it not been for the indignant outcry of the
people, who very properly regarded it as an
act of defiance, or at least of opposition,
to the express language of prophecy. But
this feeling has abated, and were the
attempt to be renewed it would meet with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
little opposition. In Catholic countries
our pictures and crucifixes perpetually set
before the Christian's eyes the sufferings
of his Redeemer, and there is no possibility
of his forgetting the history of his
religion. Even the most trifling ceremony
is of use. At one of the public schools
here, the boys on Easter Sunday rush out
of the chapel after prayers, singing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">He is risen, he is risen,</div>
<div class="verse">All the Jews must go to prison.</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>This custom is certainly very old, though
I cannot learn that it was ever usual to
imprison this wretched people upon this
festival. Some of these boys cut the straps
of a Jew's box one day, and all his gingerbread-nuts
fell into the street. Complaint
was made to the master; and when he
questioned the culprits what they could
say in their defence, one of them stepped
forward and said, "Why, sir, did not they
crucify our Lord!" Without admitting the
plea in excuse, it may be remarked that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
if the boy had not remembered his Easter
rhymes, he would have been as indifferent
to the crime of the Jews as the rest of his
countrymen.</p>

<p>Some years ago one of the best living
dramatists wrote a comedy for the purpose
of representing the Jewish character
in a favourable light. The play was very
successful, and the Jews were so well
pleased that they presented the author
with a handsome gratuity<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span>. A farce was
brought forward at another time called the
Jew Boy; and the fraternity knowing that
it was impossible to represent this class
favourably, assembled in great numbers,
and actually damned the piece. This single
fact is sufficient to prove that the liberty
which they enjoy is unbounded. It is not
merely the open exercise of their religion
which is permitted them, they are even
suffered to write and publish against Christianity.
If the permission of blasphemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
were no sin, there would be little evil in
this licence, so little are they able to make
proselytes. The only apostate whom they
have made within the memory of man is
the very person who occasioned the insurrection
against the Catholics in 1780, and
who afterwards lost his senses, renounced
his faith, and, though of noble family,
died in a public prison, a lamentable instance
of divine vengeance.</p>

<p>In Rome these misbelievers are obliged
to hear a sermon once a-week; here a
sermon attracts them as a novelty. One
of the Methodist itinerants, some few
years ago, fancying that, like St Vicente
Ferrer, he had a special gift for converting
this stiff-necked generation, undertook to
confute their errors, and invited them to
attend his preaching. The place appointed
was the great Methodist Chapel in Tottenham
Court Road; and they assembled
in such crowds as to fill the chapel and the
court in which it is built. One of the
windows was taken out, and the orator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
taking his stand in the opening, addressed
the congregation both within and without
at the same time. There can be no reason
to suppose that they came with hearts
more accessible to conviction than usual;
but, had it been the case, the method
which this fanatic took was little likely to
be successful; for he began by telling
them that he was not yet twenty years old,
that he had no human learning whatever,
and that for all he was about to say to them
he trusted to the immediate impulse of the
Lord. The rest of his discourse was in
character with the beginning, and the
Jews returned, the greater number ridiculing
his folly, the more thoughtful remembering
their own law against him who presumes
to speak in the name of the Lord,
what the Lord hath not commanded him
to speak. Yet from the readiness with
which they assembled to hear him, it does
not appear impossible, that if some true
Christian, inspired with the zeal of our
St Vicente, were to collect them together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
their curiosity might be made use of to the
triumph of the faith and the salvation of
souls.</p>

<p>The English church has no zeal for souls.
At the beginning of the last century the
daughter of a rich Jew, by name Jacob
Mendes de Breta, was at her own instance
publicly baptized. The father ran into the
church like a madman, charged the officiating
clergyman to desist, and, when he
perceived that this was in vain, cursed his
child with the bitterest imprecations, and
prayed to his God that the church might
fall in, and crush all who were concerned
in the ceremony. After this he utterly
disowned her:—the law had made no provision
for such cases, and the parish were
obliged to support her; which, to their
honour, they did in a manner suitable to
her former situation in life. At their petition,
however, a bill was enacted compelling
the Jews to provide decently for their
converted children. This much was done
upon the emergency of the case, and nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
more. Not the slightest effort is
made for their conversion, nor the slightest
impediment opposed to the public celebration
of ceremonies, which the Gospel
has expressly abrogated. The Jews have
nothing to complain of, except that they
pay tithes to the clergy, and that they are
liable to the trouble of parish offices—the
law even allowing them to be made churchwardens.
Any person may be excused
from serving this office if he chooses to pay
a fine amounting to about ten pieces of
eight: it is not long since a parish in London
nominated a Jew for the sake of getting
this money; he, however, was determined
to disappoint them by taking the
situation;—the profanation was theirs, not
his:—and accordingly the church affairs
for the year were actually managed by
this son of the Synagogue.</p>

<p>It may well be supposed that when Bonaparte
was in Syria his movements were
anxiously watched by the Jews. There was
a great stir among them, and it is probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
that if he had invited them by proclamation,
and promised to give them Palestine,
armies would have been raised to take
and keep possession of that Holy Land,
to which they look, individually and
collectively, as their destined gathering
place. Individually, I say, because it is
taught by many Rabbis, that the children
of Israel, wherever buried, can rise again
at the coming of the Messiah, nowhere
except in the Promised Land; and they,
therefore, who are interred in any other
part of the world, will have to make their
way there through the caverns of the earth;
a long and painful journey, the difficulty
and fatigue of which are equivalent to purgatory.
I know not whether this is believed
by the English Rabbis; but that the
English Jews attach as devout a reverence
to the very soil of Jerusalem as we do to
the Holy Sepulchre itself, is certain. One
of the wealthiest among them, in late
times, made a pilgrimage there; and
brought back with him boxes full of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
earth to line his grave. Unhappy people!
whose error is the more inveterate because
it is mingled with the noblest feelings, and
whose obstinate hope and heroic perseverance
we must condemn while we admire.</p>

<p>No particular dress is enjoined them by
law, nor indeed is any such mark of distinction
necessary: they are sufficiently
distinguished by a cast of complexion and
features, which, with leave of our neighbours,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span>
I will call a Portugueze look.—Some
of the lowest order let their beards
grow, and wear a sort of black tunic with a
girdle; the chief ostensible trade of this
class is in old clothes, but they deal also in
stolen goods, and not unfrequently in coining.
A race of Hebrew lads who infest you
in the streets with oranges and red slippers,
or tempt school-boys to dip in a bag for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
gingerbread nuts, are the great agents in
uttering base silver; when it is worn too
bare to circulate any longer they buy it up
at a low price, whiten the brass again,
and again send it abroad. You meet Jew
pedlars every where, travelling with boxes
of haberdashery at their backs, cuckoo
clocks, sealing-wax, quills, weather-glasses,
green spectacles, clumsy figures in
plaister of Paris, which you see over the
chimney of an alehouse parlour in the
country, or miserable prints of the king
and queen, the four seasons, the cardinal
virtues, the last naval victory, the prodigal
son, and such like subjects, even the
Nativity and the Crucifixion; but when
they meet with a likely chapman, they
produce others of the most obscene and
mischievous kind. Any thing for money,
in contempt of their own law us well as
of the law of the country:—the pork-butchers
are commonly Jews. All these
low classes have a shibboleth of their own,
as remarkable as their physiognomy; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
in some parts of the city they are so numerous,
that when I strayed into their precincts
one day, and saw so many Hebrew
inscriptions in the shop windows, and so
many long beards in the streets, I began
to fancy that I had discovered the ten
tribes.</p>

<p>Some few of the wealthiest merchants
are of this persuasion; you meet with none
among the middle order of tradesmen, except
sometimes a silversmith, or watchmaker;
ordinary profits do not content
them. Hence they are great stock-jobbers,
and the business of stock-broking is very
much in their hands. One of these Jew
brokers was in a coffee-house during the
time of the mutiny in the fleet, when tidings
arrived that the sailors had seized Admiral
Colpoys, and had actually hanged him.
The news (which afterwards proved to be
false) thunderstruck all present. If it were
true, and so it was believed to be, all hopes
of accommodation were at an end; the
mutineers could only be supprest by force,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
and what force would be able to suppress
them? While they were silent in such
reflections, the Jew was calculating his
own loss from the effect it would produce
upon the funds, and he broke the silence
by exclaiming, in Hebrew-English, <i>My
Gott! de stokes!</i> articulated with a deep
sigh, and accompanied with a shrug of
shoulders, and an elevation of eyebrows,
as emphatic as the exclamation.</p>

<p>England has been called the hell of
horses, the purgatory of servants, and the
paradise of women: it may be added that
it is the heaven of the Jews,—alas, they
have no other heaven to expect!</p>

From Jew to Infidel—an easy transition,
after the example of Acosta and Spinosa.</p>

<p>When the barriers of religion had been
broken down by the schism, a way was
opened for every kind of impiety. Infidelity
was suspected to exist at the court of
the accursed Elizabeth; it was avowed at
her successor's by Lord Herbert of Cherbury;
a man unfortunate in this deadly
error, but otherwise, for his genius and valour
and high feelings of honour, worthy
to have lived in a happier age and country.
His brother was a religious poet, famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
in his day: had they been Spaniards, the
one would have been a hero, the other a
saint; but the good seed fell among
thorns, and the thorns sprung up with it
and choked it. During the great Rebellion,
a small party of the leaders were
Deists; fanaticism was then the epidemic;
they made no attempt to spread their principles,
and were swept away at the Restoration,
which, after it had destroyed rebellion
and fanaticism, struck at the root of
liberty and morals. An open profligacy
of manners had shewn itself under the
reign of the first James; it disappeared
during the subsequent struggles, when all
the stronger passions and feelings were called
into action: but when once the country
felt itself settled in peace, this spirit
revived, and the court of Charles exhibited
a shameless indecency, of which Europe
had seen no example since the days
of the Roman emperors. Yet, perhaps,
the most shocking blasphemy of this
blasphemous age is the canonization of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
King Charles the Martyr; for such they
style him, in mockery, as it might seem, of
martyrdom, if we did not know the impudence
of adulation. His office, for his
festival is regularly celebrated, applies to
this heretical king those texts of Scripture
which most pointedly allude to the sufferings
and death of Christ. A poet of that
reign even dared to call him Christ the
Second!—It is not true that the prayers to
the most Holy Virgin were ever addressed
in the churches to Elizabeth, as Ribadaneyra
has said: but this impiety, not less
shocking, and not less absurd, is continued
to this day,—and the breviary which
contains it, in the vulgar tongue, is in
every person's hands.</p>

<p>From the time of the Revolution, in
1688, the Deists became bolder, and ventured
to attack Christianity from the press.
They did it, indeed, covertly and with decency.
The infidelity of these writers bears
no resemblance to the irreligious profligacy
of Charles's courtiers, in whom disbelief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
was the effect of a vicious heart. It proceeded
in these from an erring reason;
their books were suppressed as soon as the
tendency was discovered, and the authors
sometimes punished, so that they did little
mischief. Condorcet has mentioned some
of them as the great philosophers of England;
but the French are ridiculously ignorant
of English literature, and the truth
is that they have no reputation, nobody
ever thinking either of them or their
works. Bolingbroke alone is remembered
for his political life, so mischievous to his
own country and to Europe; his literary
fame has died a natural death,—he was
equally worthless as a writer and a man.</p>

<p>Voltaire infected this island as he did
the continent—of all authors the most mischievous
and the most detestable. His
predecessors had disbelieved Christianity,
but he hated Christ; their writings were
addressed to studious men; he wrote for
the crowd, for women and boys, addressing
himself to their vilest and basest passions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
corrupting their morals that he
might destroy their faith. Yet notwithstanding
the circulation of his worst works
on dirty paper and in worn types by travelling
auctioneers and at country fairs;
notwithstanding the atheism with which
the Scotch universities have spawned since
the days of Hume; and notwithstanding
the union between infidelity and sedition
during the late war, which ruined the democratic
party, it is remarkable how trifling
an effect has been produced. An attempt
was made some twenty years ago to
establish a deistical place of worship; it
fell to the ground for want of support.—The
Theophilanthropists never extended to
England. A few clerks and prentices will
still repeat the jests of Paine, and the blasphemies
of Voltaire; and a few surgeons
and physicians will continue in their miserable
physics or metaphysics to substitute
Nature in the place of God; but this is all.
Even these, as they grow older, conform to
some of the many modes of worship in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
country, either from conviction, or for interest,
or because, whatever they may think
of the importance of religion to themselves,
they feel that it is indispensable for
their families. Judaism can be dangerous
nowhere unless where a large proportion of
the people are concealed Jews: but that
infidelity, unrestrained as it is in this land
of error, should be able to produce so little
evil, is indeed honourable to the instincts
of our nature, and to the truth of a religion,
which, mutilated and corrupted as it
is, can still maintain its superiority.</p>

<p>Where every man is allowed to have a
faith of his own, you will not wonder if
the most ludicrous opinions should sometimes
be started, if any opinions in so important
a matter may be called ludicrous
without impiety. The strangest which I
have yet heard is that of an extraordinary
man who had passed great part of his life in
Spain. It was his opinion that there is no
God now, but that there would be one by
and by; for the organization of the universe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
when it became perfect, would produce
a universal Mind or common Sensorium.
A sailor, who published the History
of his Voyages, expresses his abhorrence
of a watery grave, because it would
be out of reach of the sun, which else, he
thought, would revivify him in the shape
of some plant or animal, such perhaps as
he might have had a sympathetic affection
for while he lived. Pythagoreans in diet
have been rather more common than in
faith. A certain Thomas Tryon attempted
to form a sect of such about a century ago;
the disciple who wrote his epitaph says
that he almost worked his body up into
soul. But, though almost every folly seems
to strike root in England as in a congenial
soil, this never could be naturalized.
The pulse diet of Shadrach, Meshech, and
Abednego, would hardly become popular
in a country where Beef-eater is a title of
honour, where the soldiers march to battle
with a song about roast-beef in their
mouths, instead of a prayer, and where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
the whole nation personify themselves by
the name of John the Bull.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span> This Tryon
published a few books in his lifetime: his
sect, if he ever formed any, died with him—and
he is so nearly forgotten, that, when
I heard him spoken of lately, a new book
upon the same principle being the topic of
conversation, the rest of the company
were as ignorant of his existence as myself.
The new book which led to this is
the work of Ritson, one of the most learned
English antiquarians, but of so unhappy a
temper, that it is generally believed he is
deranged. We should think him possessed,
from the evidence of this essay,
every page and almost every line of which
teems with blasphemy;—it is full of open
and avowed hatred of Religion and of Nature,
and declarations that if there be a
God, he must be a Being who delights in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
malignity. God have mercy upon this
poor wretched man, who seems to find a
heavier punishment in the wickedness of
his own heart, than earthly laws could inflict
upon him!</p>

<p>The principle of abstaining from animal
food is not in itself either culpable or ridiculous,
if decently discussed. <i>We</i> know
that in many cases where indulgence is not
sinful, abstinence is meritorious. There is
therefore nothing irreligious in the opinion,
and certainly it is favourable in some of its
consequences to morality. But ultimately
it resolves itself into the political question,
Whether the greater population can be
maintained upon animal or vegetable diet?
It is to be wished the Pythagoreans in
England were numerous and philosophical
enough to carry on a series of experiments
upon this subject, and upon the physical
effects of their system.</p>

<p>We who acknowledge fasting to be a
duty at stated times, and an act of devotion
at others, and who have the example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
of the more rigid monastic orders, shall
think these people less absurd than their
own countrymen think them, and perhaps
less than they really are, as the principles
of religion have nothing to do with their
speculations. But what will you say when
I tell you, that there are also Pagans in the
country, actual worshippers of Jupiter and
Juno, who believe in Orpheus instead of
Christ, Homer and Hesiod instead of the
prophets, Plato and Plotinus instead of the
apostles? There is a story of an Englishman
at Rome who pulled off his hat to a
statue of Jupiter, saying, "I beg, sir, if
ever you get into power again, you will
remember that I paid my respects to you
in your adversity." Those whom I now
speak of are more serious in their faith. I
have heard of one who sacrificed a cock to
Esculapius, at midnight, and upon a high
place, in the midst of a large city.</p>

<p>The great apostle of the Heathen gods is
one Thomas Taylor. He openly avows his
belief, saying, in a page prefixed to one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
his works, which he dedicates to the Sacred
Majesty of Truth,—"Mr Thomas Taylor,
the Platonic philosopher, and the modern
Plethon, consonant to that philosophy,
professes polytheism." For many years he
has been labouring indefatigably to propagate
this faith by the most unexceptionable
means, that of translating the Heathen
philosophers, and elucidating their most
mysterious parts. His doctrines have
made little or no progress, not because
they are too nonsensical, for in these cases
the more nonsense the better, but because
they are too obscure, and require too much
attention to be understood, if, indeed, they
be not altogether unintelligible. His fame,
however, has reached the Continent. Early
in the French Revolution the Marquis Valedi
came over to visit him: he called at
his house, dressed in white like an aspirant;
fell at his feet to worship the divine
restorer of the Platonic philosophy; rose
up to put a bank note of twenty pounds in
his hand as an offering, and insisted upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
being permitted to live in the house with
him, that he might enjoy every possible
opportunity of profiting by his lessons. In
vain did the philosopher represent the want
of room in his house, his method of living,
the inconvenience to himself and to his
pupil. Nothing would satisfy the marquis,—if
there was no other room, he
would have a bed put up in the study
where they were conversing:—away he
went to order it, and was immediately domesticated.—After
some little time it was
discovered that he was disposed to worship
the wife instead of the husband, and here
ended the Platonism. They parted, however,
in friendship. Valedi had left France
to escape from a young wife, because, he
said, she had no soul: he went back to
take a part in the Revolution. Taylor saw
him in the diligence as he was setting off;
he was in complete regimentals, with a
fierce cocked hat,—and his last words
were, "I came here Diogenes, and I return
Alexander." His fate was like that of
many wiser and better men; he perished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
by the guillotine, being one of the twenty-two
who suffered with Brissot.</p>

<p>Transmigration forms a part of this Pythagorean
Platonist's creed. He says of
Julian the Apostate, "The greatness of
his soul is so visible in his writings, that
we may safely believe what he asserted of
himself, that he had formerly been Alexander
the Great."</p>

<h2>LETTER LXV.</h2>

<p class="center gist"><i>Eagerness of the English to be at war with
Spain.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">I</span><span class="smc">t</span>
is amusing enough to hear these people
talk of the pride of the Spaniards, when
they themselves are as proud as the Portugueze.
The Dons, as they call us, are, in
their conception, very haughty, jealous
to excess, and terribly revengeful, but
honourable and right rich; therefore they
like to deal with us in time of peace, and
the slightest rumour of war makes every
sailor in the service think he is infallibly
about to make his fortune. So whenever
the government begin by going to war
with France, it is calculated upon that war
with Spain will follow. They reserve it as
a sweetener for the nation; when the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
begin to be weary of their burthens,
and to suspect that no good can come of a
contest carried on without vigour, without
system, and in fact without object or means,
a declaration against Spain puts them in
good humour, the seamen come from their
hiding-places, and pirates swarm out from
every sea-port.</p>

<p>There is certainly nothing like national
enmity between England and Spain, each
nation is too honourable not to do justice
to the character of the other. They speak
of our weakness with a contemptuous pride,
which sometimes excites a Spaniard's
shame, but more frequently his indignation;
but in their sober and settled judgment
they avow that it is the interest of
England to see us strengthened rather than
humiliated, and that their wishes accord with
their true policy. They say, and say truly,
that Spain and Portugal, united and in
health, would form an excellent counterpoise
to the power of France; that our peninsula
seems made by Nature to be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
powerful empire, and that it would be to the
advantage of Europe that it should again
become so. Yet upon the slightest pretext
for quarrelling with us all this would be
forgotten; the prospect of plunder would
intoxicate the people, the government
would do any thing to gratify the sailors,
and the buccaneering would begin again.
They forget that in proportion as they
weaken Spain they derange still more the
balance of power: they forget that by cutting
off the communication between the two
countries, they compel us to use our own
manufactures instead of theirs, thus teaching
us to become independent of them,
and doing for us what we ought to do for
ourselves; and they forget also that war
forces us to become again a military nation,
and disciplines a navy, which only wants
discipline to contend once more for the sovereignty
of the seas.</p>

<p>After all, if a balance were struck, England
would find little reason for triumph.
Our gunboats have injured the commerce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
of England more than the navy of England
can hurt the trade of Spain. A galleon
in the course of a seven years' war is but
a poor compensation for Gibraltar seven
years blockaded, and the straights lined
with armed vessels, like a defile, which
came out like greyhounds upon every merchant
ship, and insulted and endangered
their three-deckers.</p>

<p>But never were a people so easily duped.
They believe one and all that their last
war with us was exceedingly glorious,
because, by the cowardice of some of our
captains and the insubordination of others,
our fleet suffered that unfortunate defeat
off Cape St Vincent. They do not remember
how we beat their famous Nelson from
Teneriffe, where he left a limb behind him
as a relic to show that he had been there.
They forget their disgraceful repulse at
Ferrol, and their still more disgraceful
attempt upon Cadiz, when, in spite of the
governor's admirable letter, which stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
the situation of the town, and in spite of
the destructive consequences of victory to
themselves, if they had been victorious,
their troops were actually embarked in the
boats for the purpose of inflicting the
curse of war upon a people then suffering
pestilence and famine. England ought
to regard it as the happiest event of the
war that the commander recalled his orders
in time, either for shame or humanity, or
more truly under the impulse of a merciful
Providence; for had the disease once found
way into that fleet, powerful as it was, all
discipline would have been at an end; no
port could have refused admittance to such
an armament, and the pestilence would
have been spread from one extremity of
the Mediterranean to the other, and to
England herself at last.</p>

<p>They wonder that no expedition was
sent against our American possessions;
not in the least doubting that Mexico and
Peru would have fallen into their hands—as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
if we had not sent back their Drake and
their Raleigh with shame, and as if the
age of their Raleighs and Drakes was not
over! After the overthrow of Dumouriez
and his party in France, Miranda came
over to England, hoping to be employed
in some such wise project against his native
country. As quacks of every kind, political
as well as physical, flourish in this
island, it is surprising that his tales were
not listened to as well as those of the
French emigrants; for the ignorance of
this nation with respect to the history and
present state of our colonies is profound.
They do not know that after having destroyed
the bloody and execrable idolatry
of the American Indians, we imparted to
them our arts, our language, and our religion;
and that the spiritual conquests of
our missionaries were not less rapid, nor
less extraordinary, than the victories of
Cortes and Pizarro. In the sixteenth century,
the language, history, and customs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
of Mexico and Peru were elucidated in
books printed in the country, and now, in
the nineteenth, nothing issues from the
press in Jamaica and the other English
islands, except a few miserable newspapers;
every number of which contains
something disgraceful to the English character
and to human nature. I have seen
some of these precious publications. They
abound with notices which show with what
propriety these islanders cry out against the
cruelty of the Spanish conquerors. Pompey,
or Oroonoko, or Quashee, (for these
heretics never baptise their slaves!) is advertised
as a run-away: he is to be known
by the brand of a hot iron upon his breast
or forehead, the scars of the whip, and
perhaps the mark of his fetters;—and it is
sometimes added that he is supposed to be
harboured by his wife—harboured by his
wife! This phrase alone is sufficient for
national infamy.</p>

<p>It amuses me to hear these people talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
of their West Indian possessions. England
has as great an idea of her own importance
and power, as a one-eyed man
has of the magnitude of his nose, when
the candle is on his blind side.</p>

<h2>LETTER LXVI.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>Excursion to Greenwich.—Watermen.—Patent
Shot Tower.—Albion Mills.—Essex
Marshes.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">T</span><span class="smc">he</span>
English say that their palaces are
like hospitals, and their hospitals like palaces;
and the exterior of St James's and
of Greenwich justifies the saying. I have
seen this magnificent asylum for old seamen,
which is so justly the boast of the
nation.</p>

<p>As it was my wish to see the whole
course of the river through the metropolis,
I breakfasted at the west end of the town
with W. who had promised to accompany
me, and we took boat at Westminster
bridge. From no part of the river are so
many fine objects to be seen as from this.
On one side are the groves and palace of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
the Primate at Lambeth; on the other, the
residence of the Speaker, which is now repairing
in collegiate style; the abbey; and
Westminster-Hall, the great court of justice,
whose prodigious size and greater
antiquity render it an object not less venerable
and impressive than the minster.
The boats which ply upon the Thames
are admirably constructed; long, light,
and sharp, they almost fly through the
water. They are numbered and registered;
the watermen wear a badge, and have a
particular costume—any deviation from
the ordinary English dress is an improvement;—the
fares, like those of the hackney
coachmen, are regulated by law, and it is
the cheapest as well as the pleasantest
mode of conveyance. On Sundays they are
forbidden to ply<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span>—one of the stupid and
superstitious interdictions this of Calvinism—for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
Sunday is the very day on which they
would find the most employ. They sit
idly upon the bench before the alehouse-door
by the water-side, cursing the regulation
which keeps them idle; and the unlucky
person whose way lies along the
river must toil through dust and heat, a
double distance perhaps, because forsooth
no manner of work is to be done upon the
sabbath day.</p>

<p>The banks of the river are not made
ornamental to the city: a few streets come
down to it at right angles, but none are
built parallel with the water. The first
remarkable object below the bridge is a
tower constructed for making shot by a
new process: the history of its invention
is curious. About five-and-twenty years
ago a Mr Watts was engaged in this trade:
his wife dreamt that she saw him making
shot in a new manner, and related her dream
to him: he thought it worth some attention,
made the experiment, and obtained
a patent for the invention, which he afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
sold for ten thousand pounds.
A range of buildings called the Adelphi,
which are the handsomest in London, because
they are faced with a composition
having the appearance of stone,—Somerset
House, a magnificent public building,
of which the work goes on so slowly, that
one half the edifice will in the natural
course of decay become a ruin before the
other is finished,—and the gardens of the
Temple, one of the law-colleges or inns of
court as they are called, give some interest
to this part of the river: the shores are
every where choaked with barges, of which
a great number are laden with earth-coal.</p>

<p>A fine sweep of steps ascends from the
river to Blackfriars—the second of the
three bridges, close by which the common
sewers discharge themselves, and blacken
the water round about. There is a strong
echo under this bridge. On the Southwark
side are the ruins of a large building
called the Albion Mills, which was erected
for the purpose of securing to the metropolis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
a certain supply of flour. A great
capital was vested in this useful undertaking;
but perhaps in no country are clamours
so easily raised by the interested,
and so greedily believed by the ignorant,
as in England. The very axioms of commercial
policy are not understood by the people,
and it required all the firmness and
all the influence of Mr Pitt, during the
scarcity, to save the country from the inevitable
miseries which a maximum would
have occasioned. The millers themselves,
best aware of what roguery might be practised
in their own trade, spread abroad reports
that the flour was adulterated with
all sorts of base mixtures. The Albion
Mills took fire; whether by accident or
not is doubtful: but the mob, who on all
such occasions bestir themselves to extinguish
a fire with that ready and disinterested
activity which characterizes the
English, stood by now as willing spectators
of the conflagration; and before the
engines had ceased to play upon the smoking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
ruins, ballads of rejoicing were printed
and sung upon the spot. The fire broke
out during the night, a strong breeze was
blowing from the east, and the parched
corn fell in a black shower above a league
distant: even fragments of wood still burning,
fell above Westminster-bridge. There
is a floating mill upon the river thus constructed:
a gun-boat is moored head and
stern, with a house built on it, and a
wheel on each side which works with the
tide.</p>

<p>The passage of the third bridge is considered
as an achievement of some little
risque: our boat shot through it like an
arrow. Close to the bridge are the great
water-works by which the city is supplied.
When it is considered that all the filth of
this prodigious metropolis is emptied into
the river, it is perfectly astonishing that
any people should consent to drink it.
One week's expenses of the late war would
have built an aqueduct from the Surry hills,
and an hundred fountains to have distributed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
its stores. The Thames water ferments
and purifies itself: in its state of
fermentation it is inflammable. St Paul's
and the Monument are the main objects in
this reach. Below the bridges is the Tower
of London, and a forest of shipping: here
indeed we saw how truly this city may be
called the modern Tyre. Wharfs and
warehouses extend in this direction, far
beyond any part of the eastern city which
I had explored. New docks upon a great
scale are nearly completed in a marsh,
called the Isle of Dogs, so named, it is
said, because the body of a man who had
been murdered, and buried there, was discovered
by the fidelity of a dog.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>At length we came in sight of green fields
and trees. The marshes of Essex, from
whence London is so often covered with
fogs, were on one side; the Kentish hills,
not far distant, on the other; the famous
observatory of Greenwich, from whence the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
English calculate their longitude; and the
hospital, a truly noble building, worthy of
the nation which has erected it, and of the
purpose to which it is consecrated. The palace
of the Tudors stood here.—Charles II.
began to rebuild it, and William appropriated
it to its present use. About 2000
disabled seamen are supported here, and
boys are educated for the navy. We saw
the refectory and the church: but, as in a
Relicario, the place excited too much
feeling to obtain much attention: we were
in the asylum of those sailors, whose skill
and courage are unrivalled, a race of men
without fear, and as generous as they are
brave. What volumes might be compiled
from the tales which these old chroniclers
could tell! There is not a shore in the habitable
world but has been visited by some
or other of these men, nor a hardship incident
to human nature which some of them
have not sustained.</p>

<p>We walked into the Park, and up the
hill, where the rabble of London assemble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
on Easter Monday, and roll down its
green side, men and women promiscuously.
From hence we had a noble prospect
of the river, the distant shipping, and the
pestilential marshes of the opposite coast.
A story is told of an old native of these
marshes, who carried on a thriving trade
in wives. He chose them from the hill-country,
and within a few years married
and buried eight, all of whom he brought
home upon one horse.</p>

<p class="gist"><i>Spanish Gravity the Jest of the English.—Sunday
Evening described.—Society for
the Suppression of Vice.—Want of Holidays.—Bull-Baiting.—Boxing.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">O</span><span class="smc">ne</span>
of the great philosophers here has
advanced a theory that the nervous and
electric fluids are the same, both being
condensed light. If this be true, sunshine
is the food of the brain; and it is thus explained
why the southern nations are so
much more spiritual than the English,
and why they in their turn rank higher in
the scale of intellect than their northern
neighbours.</p>

<p>Spanish gravity is the jest of this people.
Whenever they introduce a Spaniard upon
the stage, it is to ridicule him for his pride,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
his jealousy, and his mustachios. According
to their notions, all our women
who are not locked up in convents, are
locked up at home; guarded by duennas
as vigilant as dragons, and husbands, every
one of whom is as fierce as the Grand
Turk. They believe, also, that a Spaniard
thinks it beneath his dignity ever to laugh,
except when he is reading Don Quixote;
then, indeed, his muscles are permitted to
relax.</p>

<p>I am writing upon Sunday evening, at
the hour when in our cities the people are
at the theatre or the bull-fight; when in
every street and village the young are dancing
with their castanets, and at every
door you hear the viola. What is the
scene in England at this time? All public
amusements are prohibited by the dæmon
of Calvinism; and for private ones,—half
the people seriously believe that were they
to touch a card on a Sunday, they should
immediately find the devil under the table,
who is said to have actually appeared upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
such an occasion to an old lady at Bath.
The Savoyard, who goes about with his
barrel-organ, dares not grind even a psalm-tune
upon the sabbath. The old woman
who sells apples at the corner of the street
has been sent to prison for profanation of
the Lord's day, by the Society for the
Suppression of Vice; the pastry-cook, indeed,
is permitted to keep his shop-window
half open, because some of the society
themselves are fond of iced creams.
Yonder goes a crowd to the Tabernacle, as
dismally as if they were going to a funeral;
the greater number are women;—enquire
for their husbands at the alehouse, and
you will find them besotting themselves
there, because all amusements are prohibited
as well as all labour, and they cannot
lie down like dogs, and sleep. Ascend a
step higher in society,—the children are
yawning, and the parents agree that the
clock must be too slow, that they may
accelerate supper and bed-time. In the
highest ranks, indeed, there is little or no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
distinction of days, except that there is
neither theatre nor opera for them, and
some among them scruple at cards. Attempts
have even been made to shut up
the public ovens on this day, and convert
the sabbath into a fast for the poor. And
these are the people who ridicule Spanish
gravity, and think they have reformed religion,
because they have divested it of all
that is cheerful, all that is beautiful, and
all that is inviting.</p>

<p>Our peasantry have a never-failing
source of amusement in the dance and the
viola. Here the poor never dance; indeed,
illegal dancing is a punishable crime,
and if they do not dance illegally they cannot
dance at all. This requires some explanation.
Partly from custom, still more
from the nature of the climate, there is no
dancing here in the open air; the houses
of the poor are too small for this diversion;
they must therefore meet at some public
house where there is a room large enough.
The rich do this also; but dancing at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
peso-duro a-head, and dancing at two
reales, are very different things—the one
is called a ball, the other a sixpenny hop.
The rich may take care of their own morals—the
police must look after the poor.
These public dancing-rooms are excellent
preparatory schools for the brothel, and
the magistrates very properly endeavour to
suppress them,—or should endeavour,—for
the recent institution of a society for the
suppression of vice, seems to imply that
the laws are not executed without such assistance.
Here I must remark, that if there
be one thing by which the English are peculiarly
distinguished from all other people
in the world, it is by their passion for
exercising authority and enacting laws.
When half a score or a dozen men combine
for any common purpose, whether to
establish an insurance-office, to cut a canal,
or even to set spies upon apple-women
on a Sunday, they embody themselves into
a company, choose out a representative
committee and a president, and issue their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
resolutions with all the forms of a legislative
body. It will be well if the slate does
not one day feel the inconvenience of this
taste for legislation.</p>

<p>Music is as little the amusement of the
people as dancing. Never was a nation so
unmusical. Perhaps the want of leisure
may be the cause. They reproach the
Catholic religion with the number of its
holidays, never considering how the want
of holidays breaks down and brutalizes the
labouring class, and that where they occur
seldom they are uniformly abused. Christmas,
Easter, and Whitsuntide, the only
seasons of festival in England, are always
devoted by the artificers and the peasantry
to riot and intoxication.</p>

<p>You may well conceive of what character
the popular amusements needs must be,
in a country where there is nothing to soften
the manners or ameliorate the condition
of the poor. The practice of bull-baiting
is not merely permitted, it is even enjoined
by the municipal law in some places. Attempts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
have twice been made in the legislature
to suppress this barbarous custom:
they were baffled and ridiculed, and some
of the most distinguished members were
absurd enough, and hard-hearted enough,
to assert, that if such sports were abolished,
there would be an end of the national
courage. Would to Heaven that this
were true! that English courage had no
better foundation than brutal ferocious
cruelty! We should no longer be insulted
in our ports, and our ships might defy
their buccaneering cruisers. Do not suppose
that this bull-baiting has any the
smallest resemblance to our bull-feasts.—Even
these I should agree with the Conde
de Norana, and with the Church, in condemning
as wicked and inhuman; but
there is a splendour in the costume, a gaiety
in the spectacle, a skill and a courage
displayed in the action, which afford some
apology for our countrymen, whereas this
English sport is even more cowardly than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
the bull-fights of the Portugueze.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span> The
men are exposed to no danger whatever;
they fasten the animal to a ring, and the
amusement is to see him toss the dogs, and
the dogs lacerate his nostrils, till they are
weary of torturing him, and then he is led
to the slaughter-house to be butchered after
their clumsy and cruel method. The
bear and the badger are baited with the
same barbarity; and if the rabble can get
nothing else, they will divert themselves
by worrying cats to death.</p>

<p>But the great delight of the English is
in boxing, or pugilism, as it is more scientifically
denominated. This practice
might easily be suppressed; it is against
the laws; the magistrates may interfere if
they please; and its frequency therefore,
under such circumstances, is an irrefragable
proof of national barbarity. Cudgel-playing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
quarter-staff, broad-sword, all of
which, brutal as such gladiatorial exhibitions
are, might have given to the soldiers
a serviceable dexterity, have yielded to this
more brutal sport, if that may be called
sport which sometimes proves fatal. When
a match is made between two prize-fighters,
the tidings are immediately communicated
to the public in the newspapers; and paragraphs
occasionally appear, saying the
rival are in training, what exercise they
take, and what diet, for some of them feed
upon raw beef as a preparative.—Meantime,
the amateurs and the gamblers choose
their party, and the state of the betts appears
also in the public newspapers from
time to time: not unfrequently the whole
is a concerted scheme, that a few rogues
may cheat a great many fools.—When the
combat at length takes place, as regular a
report is prepared for the newspapers as if
it were a national victory—the particulars
are recorded with a minuteness at once ridiculous
and disgraceful; for every movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
has its technical or slang name, and
the unprecedented science of the successful
combatant becomes the theme of general
admiration.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding all the attention
which these people bestow upon this savage
art, for which they have public schools,
they are outdone by savages. When one
of the English squadrons of discovery was
at Tongataboo, several of the natives boxed
with the sailors for love, as the phrase
is, and in every instance the savage was
victorious.</p>

<h2>LETTER LXVIII.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>The Abbé Barruel.—Journey of two Englishmen
to Avignon to join a Society of
Prophets.—Extracts from their prophetical
Books.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">I</span> <span class="smc">had</span>
prepared for you an account of a
pseudo-prophet who excited much attention
in London here at the beginning of
the last war, when, almost by accident, I
was made acquainted with some singular
circumstances which are in some manner
connected with him, and which therefore
should previously be told. These circumstances
are as authentic as they are extraordinary,
and supply a curious fact for
the history of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>We were talking one evening of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
Abbé Barruel's proofs of a conspiracy
against the governments, religion, and
morality of Christendom. A friend of J.'s
said, there was about as much truth in it
as in one of Madame Scudery's romances;
the characters introduced were real persons,
to whom false motives and manners were
imputed; a little of what was ascribed to
them had really occurred, but the whole
plot, colouring, and costume of the book,
were fictitious. It was a work, said he,
written to serve the purposes of a party,
with the same spirit and the same intent
as those which in old times led to such
absurd and monstrous calumnies against
the Jews; and, had its intent succeeded,
there would have been a political St Bartholomew's
day in England. True it was
that a society had existed, whose object was
to change or to influence the governments
of Europe; it was well organized and widely
extended, but enthusiasm, not infidelity,
was the means which they employed.</p>

<p>In proof of this, he stated the sum of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
what I shall relate more at length from the
book to which he referred as his authority,
and which I obtained from him the next
morning. Its title is this,—<i>A revealed
Knowledge of some Things that will speedily
be fulfilled in the World, communicated to
a Number of Christians brought together
at Avignon, by the Power of the Spirit of
God from all Nations; now published by
his Divine Command, for the Good of all
Men, by John Wright his Servant, and one
of the Brethren. London, printed in the
Year of Christ 1794</i>. It is one of those
innumerable pamphlets, which, being published
by inferior booksellers, and circulating
among sectarians and fanatics, never
rise into the hands of those who are
called the public, and escape the notice of
all the literary journals. They who peruse
them do it with a zeal which may truly be
called consuming; they are worn out like
a schoolboy's grammar; the form in which
they are sent abroad, without covers to protect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
them, hastens their destruction, and
in a few years they disappear for ever.</p>

<p>John Wright, the author of this narrative,
was a working carpenter of Leeds, in
Yorkshire; a man of strong devotional
feelings, who seems, like the first Quakers,
to have hungered and thirsted after religious
truth in a land where there was none to
impart it. Some travelling Swedenborgian
preachers having heated his imagination,
he was desirous of removing to London,
to find out the New Jerusalem Church.
It was no easy thing for a labouring man
with a large family to remove to such a
distance: however, by working over hours,
he saved money enough to effect it. The
New Jerusalem Church did not satisfy him;
every thing was too definite and formal,
too bodily and gross for a mind of his complexion.
But it so happened that at this
place of worship he entered into talk with
a converted Jew, who, when he learnt his
state of mind, and that he expected the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
restoration of the Jews would shortly be
accomplished, said to him, I will tell you
of a man who is just like yourself;—his
name is William Bryan, and he lives in
such a place.</p>

<p>Bryan was a journeyman copper-plate-printer.
J.'s friend saw him once at the
house of one of the Brotherists; he says
that before he saw him he had heard of his
resemblance to the pictures of our Lord,
but that it was so striking as truly to astonish
him. These features, his full clear
and gentle eye, the beauty of his complexion,
which would have been remarkable
even in a girl, and the voice, in which
words flowed from him with such unaffected
and natural eloquence, as to remind
the hearer of the old metaphorical descriptions
of oratory, united to produce such
an effect upon his believers as you may
conceive, considering that they were credulous,
and he himself undoubtedly sincere.
Wright had now found a man after
his own heart. They were both Quietists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
whom, for want of a guide, their own good
feelings led astray, and their experiences,
he says, operated with each other, as face
answers face in a glass.</p>

<p>Bryan told him of a society of prophets
at Avignon, assembled there from all parts
of the world. This was in the autumn
of 1788. In the January of the ensuing
year, Wright mistook strong inclination
for inspiration, and thought the Spirit directed
him to join them. The same spirit
very naturally sent him to communicate
this to Bryan, whom he found possessed
with the same impression. Neither of them
had money to leave with their families, or
to support themselves upon the journey,
and neither of them understood a word of
French. Both were determined to go—Bryan
that night, Wright the following
morning—such being their implicit obedience
to the impulse within them, that the
one would not wait, nor the other hasten.
Before his departure Bryan called upon a
friend, who said to him, "William, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
had it in my mind to ask if thou wert not
sometimes in want of money?" He acknowledged
that it was this want which
now brought him there; and the friend
gave him four guineas. If this same
friend was the person who first told him of
the society at Avignon, as may reasonably
be suspected, the whole collusion will be
clear. One guinea he left with his wife,
who was at that time in child-bed, gave
half-a-guinea to Wright to carry him to
Dover, and set off.</p>

<p>Bryan's wife, not being in a state of belief,
was greatly offended with Wright,
thinking that if it had not been for him her
husband would not have left her. His own
wife was in a happier temper of mind, and
encouraged him to go. She had a son by
a former husband who was some little support
to her, and who acquiesced in the
necessity of this journey. He seems indeed
to have communicated something of
his own fervour to all about him. A young
man with whom he was intimate, bought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
him several things for his journey, and gave
him a guinea; this same person befriended
his family during his absence. At three
in the morning he rose to depart: his son-in-law
prepared breakfast, and they made
the watchman who had called him partake
of it, for it was severely cold. "I then,"
says Wright, "turned to my children, who
were all fast asleep, and kissed them, and
interceded with the great and merciful
God, relating to him their situation, in
which, for his sake, they were going to be
left without any outward dependence;—and
at that time some of them were lying
on a bed of shavings that I used to bring
from my shop; at the same time imploring
him that he would be pleased to bless them,
and if one friend failed, another might be
raised up, as I did not know whether I
ever should see them any more; for, although
our first journey was to Avignon,
we did not know it would end there."</p>

<p>He then went to Bryan's wife, whom
his own was nursing in child-bed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
poor woman's resentment had now given
way, the quiet self-devotion of her husband
and his friend had almost persuaded
her to believe also; she burst into tears
when she saw him, and saluted him, as
he says, in the fear and love of God, in
which she bade him remember her to her
husband. Wright then went to the coach.
Soon after they left London it began to
rain and snow, and he was on the outside.
He was of a sickly habit, always
liable to take cold, and had at this time a
bad cough. A doubt came upon him, that
if the Lord had sent him he would certainly
have caused it to be fine weather.
Besides this, he began to fear that Bryan
would already have crost the channel,
in which case, when he got to Dover, he
should have no money to pay his passage.
Was it not better therefore to turn back?
But the testimony of God's power in his
heart, he says, was greater than all these
thoughts.</p>

<p>The wind had been contrary, and detained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
Bryan. They crossed over to Calais,
took some food at an inn there, and got
their money changed, enquired the names
of bread, wine, and sleeping, in the language
of the country, and which way they were
to go, and then set off on their journey.
They travelled on foot to Paris. Wright's
feet were sorely blistered; but there was no
stopping, for his "mind was bound in the
spirit to travel on." They carried their
burthen by turns when both were able, but
it generally fell upon Bryan as the stronger
man. Change of climate, however, aided
probably by the faith which was in him,
removed Wright's cough. Their funds
just lasted to Paris; here Bryan had an
acquaintance, to whose house they went.
This man had received a letter to say who
were coming, and that they were bad men,
Wright in particular, whom it advised him
to send back. As you may suppose, he
was soon fully satisfied with them—he
entertained them three days, and then dismissed
them, giving them five <i>louis d'ors</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
to bear them on. The whole journal of
their way is interesting: it relates instances
of that subsiding of overwrought feelings
which bodily exhaustion produces, and
which enthusiasts call desertion; of natural
thoughts and fears recurring, remembrances
of home, and depression which
sometimes occasioned self-suspicion and
half-repentance:—with these symptoms
the church is well acquainted, as common
to the deluded, and to those who are in
truth under the influence of divine inspiration,
and they prove the sincerity of
this narrative.</p>

<p>At length they came in sight of Avignon.
They washed some linen in the
river, sat down under the bushes till it
was dry, then put it on; and, having thus
made their appearance as decent as they
could, proceeded to the house of the prophets,
to which, as it appears, they had
brought with them a sufficient direction.
The door was opened by one of the brethren,
and by a person who could speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
English, and who had arrived there a day
or two before from another part of the
world. After they had washed and shaved,
they were taken across the street to another
house, and shown into a large room, where
there was a table spread, nearly the whole
length; they were told that table was provided
by the Lord, and when they wanted
any thing to eat or to drink they were to
go there, and they would find a servant
ready to wait upon them. The brethren
also provided them with clothes and whatever
else they needed, and with money to
give to the poor, saying they had orders
from the Lord to do so. In a short time
their Paris friend arrived, and was admitted
a member of the society before them, that
he might be their interpreter. I wish the
form of initiation had been given. They
met every evening to commemorate the
death of our Lord by eating bread and
drinking wine. Very often, says Wright,
when we have been sitting together, the
furniture in the room has been shaken as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
though it were all coming to pieces; and
upon enquiring what was the cause, we
were told that it announced the presence
of angels; and when these were not heard,
the brethren were always afraid that something
was amiss, and so enquired at the
Word of the Lord.</p>

<p>You will easily suppose that they had
orders to keep the society secret till the
appointed time. I much wish that the
book had stated how their answers from
the Lord were received, but on this it is
silent. The drift and charter of the society
are, however, sufficiently manifested
by the Extracts which Wright has published
from their Journals, and of which I
here subjoin enough to satisfy you:</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="gap-above2">"You will soon see the pride of the Mahometan
in the field; several sovereigns will unite to lay it
low. It is then that the great light will appear.
These perfidious enemies of the name of God will
keep themselves up for a time in their obstinacy,
and in the mean time will grow up he who shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
destroy them. Before the end of this year they
will begin to show their fierceness, and you will hear
of extraordinary things and memorable feats. You
will hear that the world is filled with trouble and
dissension; father, son, relations, friends, all will be
in motion; and it is in this year (1789) that all will
have its beginning.</p>

<p>"Remember that the face of the world will be
changed, and you shall see it restored to its first
state. The thrones shall be overturned, the earth
shall be furrowed and change its aspect. They who
shall be alive at that time will envy the fate of the
dead.</p>

<p>"The world will very soon be filled with trouble.
Every where people will experience misfortunes. I
announce it to you before-hand. The shepherd will
forsake his flock; the sheep will be dispersed. He
will oppress another land, and the nations will rise
up in arms.</p>

<p>"You will learn very soon that a part of the
world is in confusion; that the chiefs of nations are
armed one against another. The earth will be overflowed
with blood. You will hear of the death of
several sovereigns; they give themselves up to luxury,
they live in pleasures, but at last one of them
will fall and make an unhappy end.</p>

<p>"All the events of this century have been foreseen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
and no century has been distinguished by so
many prodigies, but the ensuing will be filled with
much greater still.</p>

<p>"The fire is kindled, the moment is come, the
Mahometan is going to fall. Asia and Africa are
staggering; fear pursues them, and they have a
glimpse of the fate that awaits them.</p>

<p>"The cross of Jesus Christ shall be set up and
triumph in those vast countries where it has been so
long despised. Then Palestine will become again the
most fortunate country on the earth; it shall be
the centre of that faith of which it was the cradle,
and from thence faith will spread itself all over the
earth. All the people will embrace it. The world
will become again what it was in the beginning.
The enlightened Jews will embrace the Catholic faith.
All people will acknowledge God, the only true God.
They will be guided by one only Pastor, and governed
by one sole Master.</p>

<p>"The second Zion has contributed the most to
misguide the spirits of men. She has introduced new
Gentiles still more monstrous than those who have
reigned upon the earth. She only wants the statues
of the Gods to resemble the ancient times. Yea,
they have been replaced by these carnal divinities to
which they render a sacrilegious adoration, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
lavish an incense to them which they refuse to
God.</p>

<p>"The end of this century will be a series of calamities
for the people. Very few men are struck
with the rapid decline of the present age. All the
nations will be enlightened to see their dangerous errors.
They will acknowledge how much they have
been deceived by the masters who have instructed
them, and they will be desolated at the thoughts of
having lost so precious a treasure, for having believed
such rascals. But at the marked time how
many errors will they not abjure, when our children
every where, in the name of God, shall make their
impious and monstrous errors disappear!—And thou,
Crescent, who so much at this day applaudest thyself,
the lustre with which thou shinest is soon to be
eclipsed;—thy unjust conquests have long enough
spun out the time of thy empire, and thy power
from one pole to another is far enough extended.
Thou dost not suspect that thy ruin is so near, and
thou dost not know him who is growing up to operate
it.</p>

<p>"Here is the time in which God will break the
laws made by the children of the earth. Here is the
time wherein he will reprove the science of men, and
here is the time of his justice. This is the time that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
we must believe all those who announce the new
reign of the Lord, for his spirit is with them.</p>

<p>"The ages have not now long to linger for the
accomplishment of the promises of the Eternal.—The
Eternal calls the times which walk in the shadows
and days of darkness, without light and without
strength, to come and change the face of the world,
and commence his new reign. This is the time of the
new Heavens and the new Earth.</p>

<p>"The Eternal has spoken, I shall simplify all
things for the happiness of my elect. The moment
is at hand when the confusion of languages shall no
more be an obstacle to the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p>"When the impious and his superb eagle in his
fury will dare to declare war against the God of Heaven,
every thing will give way immediately to his
pride. He will dare to make victims for himself
among the saints whom Heaven has chosen; he will
dare to profane their asylums, to appropriate to himself
the gifts of the Eternal by the blackest of crimes,
and by his success strengthening his pride he will believe
himself master of the world. Then—then—Heaven
will stop him: a feeble child will subdue his
valour, and his fall will testify that in the sight of
the Eternal there is no other power but the power of
his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
"Already the measure is filled; already the times
are accomplished, and the reign of the Word is at
hand. Terror will precede to enlighten the blind
who go astray, to humble the obstinate high-minded
men, and to punish the impious."</p>

</div>

<p class="gap-above2">These are no common prophecies. Honest
fanaticism has had no share in manufacturing
them. Vague as the language
necessarily is, there is an end and aim in
it not to be mistaken; and it is almost
startling to observe how much of what was
designed has taken place, and how much
may still be applied to these immediate
times.</p>

<p>Among these communications "For the
Benefit and Instruction of all Mankind,"
are others which are addressed to Wright
and Bryan, and to those who, like them,
were the unsuspecting tools of the society.
I copy them with their cyphers and forms.</p>

<p>Some things seem to have been inserted
in their journal in condescension to the
weaker brethren, who required to be amused.
Such as the following instances:—</p>

<div class="small">

<p>In the month of June, 1789, we received a letter
from the Union at Rome, which informed us that
the weather was as cold there as it is in England in
the month of January, and the Archangel Raphael
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
asked the brethren and sisters if the cold made them
uneasy, and said, Have a little patience, and the
weather will be warm enough.</p>

<p>"The 17th of June, 1789, we received a letter
from the Union at Rome, in which they informed us
of a sister, the daughter of a Turk, whom Brother
Brimmore baptized at Silesia, in the dominions of
the king of Prussia, between ten and fifteen years
ago; after having lived some time in the enjoyment
of the Christian faith, she was suddenly taken by
her father, and carried to Alexandria in Egypt,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span>
which is in the dominions of the Turk, where she
lived with her father in much sorrow and trouble.
After her father was dead, she was ordered by the
Archangel Raphael to dress herself in a soldier's
dress, and fly into a Christian country; which she
did, and got aboard a Spanish ship, and from this
date has been between two and three months at sea."</p>

</div>

<p>But though the society occasionally accommodated
itself to the capacity of the
weaker brethren, its oracles were more
frequently delivered to correct troublesome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
credulity, or repress more troublesome
doubts.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Raphael is the spirit which thy heart followed,

It will be great if thou makest haste to offer to thy
God, who chuseth thee, the vain efforts of a useless
knowledge, when it is only necessary to obey. Forget—forget
thy knowledge: it fatigues thy spirits,
it hurts thy heart, and retards from thy soul the influence
of Heaven. Renounce, in fine, to search
into the sublime mysteries of thy God. Believe—believe,

<p>The subject is so curious that I think
you will be pleased to see the character of
this mysterious society further exemplified
by a few of the sentences, moral

they delivered as from Heaven. The
first is sufficiently remarkable:—</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Woe to him who dares to cover a lie with the
sacred name of the Eternal!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
"One ray of light is not the entire light.</p>

<p>"A wise man is silent when he ought to be so.</p>

<p>"It is to the simple of heart that the Eternal
will grant the wisdom of the Spirit.</p>

<p>"The night was before the day, the day is before
the night.</p>

<p>"When God commands, he who consulteth does
not obey.</p>

<p>"He who walketh alone easily goes astray.</p>

<p>"To doubt, Is that believing? and to tremble, Is

<p>This narrative, and these extracts, require
no comment. They prove incontestably
the existence of a society of political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
Jesuits; they prove also, that however
little may have been the religion of these
men themselves, they were convinced how
indispensably necessary it was for mankind;
and that, instead of plotting to
break up the system of social order by destroying
faith and morals, faith was the
engine which they employed to prepare
society for some imaginary amelioration,
forgetting that nothing which is founded
upon delusion can be permanent.</p>

<p>The two Englishmen remained at Avignon
six months, and were then informed
by the Spirit that they might return. The
brethren supplied them with money, so
that they went back with more comfort
than they came, and had a handsome sum
left when they landed in England, where
they both returned to their former employments,
expecting the accomplishment of
the mighty changes which had been foretold.
The Revolution brake out.—They
who had raised the storm could not direct
it: they became its victims—and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
knavery reaped what fanaticism had sown,
as they who lag in the assault enter the
breach over the bodies of the brave who
have won the passage for them. What
became of the Avignon society Heaven
knows. The honest dupes whom they had
sent abroad, fully prepared to welcome any
novelty as the commencement of the Millennium,
were left to their own direction.
A king of the Hebrews appeared in England,
and Wright and Bryan were, as you
may suppose, among the first to acknowledge
him. They imagined that the appointed
time was come, and published
these secrets of the society which they had
been ordered to keep concealed. Of the
King of the Hebrews in my next.</p>

<h2>LETTER LXIX.</h2>

<p class="gist center"><i>Account of Richard Brothers.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">M</span><span class="smc">y</span>
former letters must have shown you
that these English, whom we are accustomed
to consider as an unbelieving people, are
in reality miserably prone to superstition;
yet you will perhaps be surprised at the
new instance which I am about to relate.</p>

<p>There started up in London, about the
beginning of the late war, a new pseudo-prophet,
whose name was Richard Brothers,
and who called himself King of the
Hebrews, and Nephew of God. He taught,
that all existing souls had been created at
the same time with Adam, and his system
was, that they had all lived with him in Paradise,
and all fallen with him in consequence
of their joint transgression; for all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
things which they saw and knew were in
God, and indeed were God, and they desired
to know something besides God, in
which desire they were indulged, fatally
for themselves, for the only thing which is
not God is Evil. Evil was thus introduced,
and they for their punishment cast
into hell, that is to say, upon this present
earth; and in this hell they have remained
from that time till now, transmigrating
from one human body to another. But
the term of their punishment is now drawing
towards its close: the consummation
of all things is at hand, and every one will
then recover the recollection of all the
scenes and changes through which he has
passed. This knowledge has already been
vouchsafed in part to Brothers himself,
and it is thus that he explained the extraordinary
relationship to the Almighty
which he laid claim to, asserting that in
the days of our Lord, he was the son of
James, the Brother of Christ. You know
the heretics in their hatred to virginity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
and to Mary the most pure, maintain that
when Christ's brethren are mentioned in
the Gospels, the word is to be understood
in its literal and carnal sense; consequently
he was then the Nephew of the second
Person in the Trinity.</p>

<p>Human fancy, it has been said, cannot
imagine a monster whose constituent parts
are not all already in existence; it is nearly
as impossible for a new heresy to be now
devised, so prolific has human error been.
This metempsychosis not only bears a general
resemblance to that doctrine as held
by the Orientals and by Pythagoras, but
has been held in this peculiar heretical
form by the old heretic Barules, and by
the Flagellants of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>Brothers had been a lieutenant in the
navy, and was known to be insane; but
when a madman calls himself inspired,
from that moment the disorder becomes
infectious. The society at Avignon had
unintentionally trained up apostles for this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
man. Wright and Bryan had now for
some years been looking for the kingdom
of Christ, and teaching all within the circle
of their influence to expect the same
promised day. Of what had been announced
to them, much had been too truly accomplished.
The world was indeed filled
with troubles and dissension, the fire was
kindled, the thrones of Europe were
shaken, and one of its kings had been
brought to an unhappy end, according
to the prediction. The laws made by the
children of the earth were broken, the
reign of terror was begun, and the times
disastrous to the full measure of their prophecies.
They had been instructed to look
for a miraculous deliverer and Lord of the
earth, and here was one who laid claim
to the character. There were, however,
some difficulties. At Avignon they had
been informed, that he who was to be the
Leader of the Faithful, and to overthrow
the kingdoms of the world, was at that
time twelve years old, and living at Rome;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
even his name had been revealed.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span> Neither
in this, nor in age, nor country, did
Brothers answer the prophecy. One of
these men therefore decided in his own
mind that he was an impostor; he went to
see him, with a full belief that whether he
was so or not would be revealed to him
during the interview, and he took a knife
with him, with which, if his suspicions had
been confirmed, he was resolved to deliver
him such a message from the Lord as
Ehud carried to the king of Eglon.
Luckily for both parties, Brothers, who
little knew the dangerous trial he was undergoing,
supported his part so well, that
the desperate fanatic was converted.</p>

<p>The new King of the Hebrews had not
perhaps a single Jew among his believers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
These people, who have in old times suffered
well nigh as severely for their credulity
in false Messiahs, as for their rejection
of the true one, are less disposed to lend
ear to such delusions now than in any
former time, and here than in any other
country. Here they have no amelioration of
their condition to wish for; the free exercise
of their religion is permitted, what
they gain they enjoy in security, and are
protected by the state without the trouble
of self-defence. The flesh pots of England
are not less delicious than those of Egypt,
and a land flowing with milk and honey
not so attractive for the sons of the Synagogue,
as one which abounds with old
clothes for the lower order, and loans and
contracts for their wealthier brethren. The
land of promise offers nothing so tempting
to them as scrip and omnium. The King
of the Hebrews therefore was not acknowledged
by any of his own people; his
scheme of pre-existence helped him out of
this difficulty. He could tell if any person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
had been a Jew in any former stage of
being, and even of what tribe: that of
Judah, as the most favoured, he bestowed
liberally upon his believers, and those
whom he hoped to convert. He informed
Mr Pitt by letter that he was a Jew, some
of the royal family were in like manner declared
to be Jews, and J.'s friend received
from Bryan the same flattering assurance.</p>

<p>Besides the prophets from Avignon,
Brothers succeeded in making two other
useful and extraordinary disciples. The
one, an engraver of first-rate skill in his
art, who published a masterly portrait of
him, with these words underneath, <i>Fully
believing this to be the man whom God
hath appointed, I engrave his likeness</i>.
This was to be seen in all the print-shops.
Mr Halhed was the other of these converts,
a member of the house of commons,
and one of the profoundest oriental scholars
then living. This gentleman was in
the early part of his life an unbeliever, and
had attempted to invalidate the truths of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
holy writ by arguments deduced from
Indian chronology. The study of Indian
mythology brought him back to Christianity,
and by a strange perversion of intellect,
the Trimourtee of the Hindoos convinced
him of the doctrine of the Trinity;
and as he recovered his faith he lost his
wits. To the astonishment of the world
he published a pamphlet avowing his belief
that Richard Brothers was the Lion of
the Tribe of Judah, and that in him the
prophecies were speedily to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Brothers wrote letters to the king, and
to all the members of both houses of parliament,
calling upon them to give ear to
the word of God, and prepare for the
speedy establishment of his kingdom upon
earth. He announced to his believers his
intention of speedily setting out for Jerusalem
to take possession of his metropolis,
and invited them to accompany him.
Some of these poor people actually shut
up their shops, forsook their business and
their families, and travelled from distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
parts of the country to London to join him,
and depart with him whenever he gave the
word. Before he went, he said, he would
prove the truth of his mission by a public
miracle; he would throw down his stick
in the Strand at noon-day, and it should
become a serpent; and he affirmed that he
had already made the experiment and successfully
performed it in private. A manifest
falsehood this, but not a wilful one;
in like manner he said that he had seen
the Devil walking leisurely up Tottenham-Court-road;—the
man was evidently in
such a state of mind that his waking dreams
were mistaken for realities. He threatened
London with an earthquake because of its
unbelief, and at length named the day when
the city should be destroyed. Many persons
left town to avoid this threatened calamity;
the day passed by, he claimed the
merit of having prevailed in prayer and obtained
a respite, and fixed another.</p>

<p>The business was becoming serious:
all the madmen and enthusiasts in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
a land wherein there is never any
lack of them, made a common cause with
this King of the Hebrews. Pamphlets in
his favour swarmed from the press; the
prophecy of some old heretic was raked up,
which fixed the downfall of the church as
destined now to be accomplished; and the
number of the Beast was explained by
Ludovicus XVI. One madman printed
his dreams, another his day-visions; one
had seen an angel come out of the sun
with a drawn sword in his hand, another
had seen fiery dragons in the air, and hosts
of angels in battle array: these signs and
tokens were represented in rude engravings,
and the lower classes of people, to whose
capacity and whose hungry superstition
they were addressed, began to believe that
the seven seals were about to be opened,
and all the wonders in the Apocalypse
would be displayed. Government at last
thought fit to interfere, and committed
Brothers to the national hospital for madmen.
Mr Halhed made a speech in parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
upon this occasion, the most extraordinary
perhaps that ever was delivered
to a legislative assembly. It was a calm
and logical remonstrance against the illegality
and unreasonableness of their proceedings.
They had imprisoned this person
as a madman, he said, because he announced
himself as a prophet; but it was
incumbent upon them to have fairly examined
his pretensions, and ascertained
their truth or falsehood, before they had
proceeded against him in this manner.
Brothers had appealed to the Holy Scriptures,
the divine authority of which that
house acknowledged; he appealed also to
certain of his own predictions as contained
in the letters which he had addressed to
the king and his ministers;—let them
be produced, and the question solemnly
investigated as its importance deserved.
According to the rules of the house of
commons, no motion can be debated
or put to the vote, unless it be seconded;
Mr Halhed found no one to second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
him, and his proposal was thus silently
negatived.</p>

<p>Thus easily and effectually was this wild
heresy crushed. Brothers continued to
threaten earthquakes, fix days for them,
and prorogue them after the day was past;
but his influence was at an end. The
people had lost sight of him; and being
no longer agitated by signs and tokens,
dreams and denunciations, they forgot
him. A few of his steadier adherents persisted
in their belief, and comforted him
and themselves by reminding him of Daniel
in the lions' den, and of Jeremiah in
the dungeon. He was lucky enough to
find out better consolation for himself.
There was a female lunatic in the same
hospital, whom he discovered to be the destined
Queen of the Hebrews; and as such
announced her to the world. At present
he and his chosen partner of the throne of
David are in daily expectation of a miraculous
deliverance, after which they are to
proceed to Jerusalem to be crowned, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
commence their reign. Plans and elevations
of their palace and of the new Temple
have been made for them, and are now
being engraved for the public; and in
these dreams they will probably continue
as long as they live. Upon madmen of
this stamp, experience has as little effect
as hellebore. Their thoughts of the future
are so delightful that they forget the past,
and are well nigh insensible to the present,
just as all other objects near or distant appear
darkened to him who has been looking
at the sun. Their hope has neither
fear nor doubt to allay it, and its intensity
gives them a joy which could scarcely be
exceeded by its accomplishment.</p>

<h2>LETTER LXX.</h2>

<p class="gist center"><i>Account of Joanna Southcott.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">I</span><span class="smc">n</span>
the early part of the thirteenth century
there appeared an English virgin in Italy,
beautiful and eloquent, who affirmed that
the Holy Ghost was incarnate in her for
the redemption of women, and she baptized
women in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of herself. Her body
was carried to Milan and burnt there. An
arch-heretic of the same sex and country
is now establishing a sect in England,
founded upon a not dissimilar and equally
portentous blasphemy. The name of this
woman is Joanna Southcott; she neither
boasts of the charms of her forerunner,
nor needs them. Instead of having an eye
which can fascinate, and a tongue which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
can persuade to error by glossing it with
sweet discourse, she is old, vulgar, and illiterate.
In all the innumerable volumes
which she has sent into the world, there
are not three connected sentences in sequence,
and the language alikes violates
common sense and common syntax. Yet
she has her followers among the educated
classes, and even among the beneficed
clergy. "If Adam," she says, "had refused
listening to a foolish ignorant woman
at first, then man might refuse listening
to a foolish ignorant woman at last!"—and
the argument is admitted by her
adherents. When we read in romance
of enchanted fountains, they are described
as flowing with such clear and sparkling
waters as tempt the traveller to thirst;
here, there may be a magic in the draught,
but he who can taste of so foul a stream
must previously have lost his senses. The
filth and the abominations of demoniacal
witchcraft are emblematical of such
delusions; not the golden goblet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
bewitching allurements of Circe and Armida.</p>

<p>The patient and resolute obedience with
which I have collected for you some account
of this woman and her system, from
a pile of pamphlets half a yard high, will,
I hope, be imputed to me as a merit. Had
the heretics of old been half as voluminous,
and half as dull, St Epiphanius would never
have persevered through his task.</p>

<p>She was born in Devonshire about the
middle of the last century, and seems to
have passed forty years of her life in honest
industry, sometimes as a servant, at others
working at the upholsterers' business, without
any other symptom of a disordered intellect
than that she was zealously attached
to the Methodists. These people were
equally well qualified to teach her the arts
of imposture, or to drive her mad; or to
produce in her a happy mixture of craziness
and knavery, ingredients which in
such cases are usually found in combination.
She mentions in her books a preacher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
who frequented her master's house,
and, according to her account, lived in
habits of adultery with the wife, trying at
the same time to debauch the daughter,
while the husband vainly attempted to seduce
Joanna herself. This preacher used
to terrify all who heard him in prayer, and
make them shriek out convulsively. He
said that he had sometimes, at a meeting,
made the whole congregation lie stiff upon
the floor till he had got the evil spirits out
of them; that there never was a man so
highly favoured of God as himself; that
he would not thank God to make him any
thing, unless he made him greater than
any man upon earth, and gave him power
above all men; and he boasted, upon hearing
the death of one who had censured
him, that he had fasted and prayed three
days and three nights, beseeching God to
take vengeance upon that man and send
him to eternity. Where such impious
bedlamites as this are allowed to walk
abroad, it is not to be wondered at that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
madness should become epidemic. Joanna
Southcott lived in a house which this man
frequented, and where, notwithstanding
his infamous life, his pretensions to supernatural
gifts were acknowledged, and he
was accustomed to preach and pray. The
servants all stood in fear of him. She
says he had no power over her, but she
used to think the room was full of spirits
when he was in prayer; and he was so
haunted that he never could sleep in a
room by himself, for he said his wife came
every night to trouble him: she was perplexed
about him, fully believing that
he wrought miracles, and wondering by
what spirit he wrought them. After she
became a prophetess herself, she discovered
that this Sanderson was the false prophet
in the Revelations, who is to be taken
with the Beast, and cast alive with him
into a lake of burning brimstone.</p>

<p>Four persons have written to Joanna
upon the subject of her pretended mission,
each calling himself Christ! One Mr

Leach, a Methodist preacher, told her to
go to the Lord in <i>his name</i>, and tell the
Lord that <i>he said</i> her writings were inspired
by the Devil. These circumstances show
how commonly delusion, blasphemy, and
madness are to be found in this country,
and may lessen our wonder at the phrenzy
of Joanna and her followers. Her own career
began humbly, with prophecies concerning
the weather, such as the popular
English almanacks contain, and threats
concerning the fate of Europe and the
successes of the French, which were at
that time the speculations of every newspaper,
and of every alehouse politician.
Some of these guesses having chanced to
be right, the women of the family in
which she then worked at the upholstering
business began to lend ear to her, and she
ventured to submit her papers to the judgment
of one Mr Pomeroy, the clergyman
whose church she attended in Exeter. He
listened to her with timid curiosity, rather
wanting courage than credulity to become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
her disciple; received from her certain
sealed prophecies which were at some future
time to be opened, when, as it would
be seen that they had been accomplished,
they would prove the truth of her inspiration;
and sanctioned, or seemed to sanction,
her design of publishing her call to
the world. But in this publication his
own named appeared, and that in such a
manner as plainly to imply, that if he had
not encouraged her to print, he had not
endeavoured to prevent her from so doing.
His eyes were immediately opened to his
own imprudence, whatever they may have
been to the nature of her call, and he obtained
her consent to insert an advertisement
in the newspaper with her signature,
stating that he had said it was the work
of the Devil. But here the parties are at
issue: as the advertisement was worded, it
signifies that Mr Pomeroy always said her
calling was from the Devil; on the other
hand, Joanna and her witnesses protest that
what she had signed was merely an acknowledgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
that Mr Pomeroy had said, after
her book was printed, the Devil had instigated
her to print his name in it. This
would not be worthy of mention, if it were
not for the very extraordinary situation
into which this gentleman has brought
himself. Wishing to be clear of the connection
in which he had so unluckily engaged,
he burnt the sealed papers which
had been entrusted to his care. From that
time all the Joannians, who are now no inconsiderable
number, regard him as the
arch-apostate. He is the Jehoiakim who
burnt Jeremiah's roll of prophecies; he is
their Judas Iscariot, a second Lucifer, son
of the Morning. They call upon him to
produce these prophecies, which she boldly
asserts, and they implicitly believe, have
all been fulfilled, and therefore would convince
the world of the truth of her mission.
In vain does Mr Pomeroy answer
that he has burnt these unhappy papers:—in
an unhappy hour for himself did he
burn them! Day after day long letters are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
dispatched to him, sometimes from Joanna
herself, sometimes from her brother, sometimes
from one of her four-and-twenty
elders, filled with exhortation, invective,
texts of scripture, and denunciations of the
Law in this world and the Devil in the next;
and these letters the prophetess prints, for
this very sufficient reason—that all her
believers purchase them. Mr Pomeroy
sometimes treats them with contempt, at
other times he appeals to their compassion,
and beseeches them, if they have any
bowels of Christian charity, to have compassion
on him, and let him rest, and no
longer add to the inconceivable and irreparable
injuries which they have already
occasioned him. If he is silent, no matter,
on they go, printing copies of all which
they write, and when he is worried into
replying, his answers also serve to swell
Joanna's books. In this manner is this
poor man, because he has recovered his
senses, persecuted by a crazy prophetess,
and her four-and-twenty crazy elders, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
seem determined not to desist, till, one way
or other, they have made him as ripe for
Bedlam as they are themselves.</p>

<p>The books which she sends into the
world are written partly in prose, partly
in rhyme, all the verse, and the greater part
of the prose, being delivered in the character
of the Almighty! It is not possible to
convey any adequate idea of this unparalleled
and unimaginable nonsense by any
other means than literal transcript.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span> Her
hand-writing was illegibly bad, so that at
last she found it convenient to receive orders
to throw away the pen, and deliver
her oracles orally; and her words flow
from her faster than her scribes can write
them down. This may be well believed,
for they are mere words, and nothing else:
a rhapsody of texts, vulgar dreams, and
vulgar interpretations, vulgar types and
vulgar applications:—the vilest string of
words in the vilest doggerel verse, which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
no other connection than what the vilest
rhymes have suggested, she vents, and her
followers receive, as the dictates of immediate
inspiration. A herd, however, was
ready to devour this garbage as the bread of
life. Credulity and Vanity are foul feeders.</p>

<p>The clergy in her own neighbourhood
were invited by her, by private letters, to
examine her claims, but they treated her
invitation with contempt: the bishop also
did not choose to interfere;—of what avail,
indeed, would it have been to have examined
her, when they had no power to
silence her blasphemies! She found believers
at a distance. Seven men came
from different parts of the country to examine—that
is—to believe in her; these
were her seven stars; and when at another
time seven more arrived upon the same
wise errand, she observed, in allusion to
one of those vulgar sayings from which all
her allusions are drawn, that her seven
stars were come to fourteen. Among these
early believers were three clergymen,
one of them a man of fashion, fortune,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
and noble family. It is not unlikely that
the woman at first suspected the state of
her own intellects: her letters appear to
indicate this; they express a humble submission
to wiser judgments than her own;
and could she have breathed the first
thoughts of delusion into the ear of some
pious confessor, it is more than probable
that she would have soon acknowledged
her error at his feet, and the phrensy which
has now infected thousands would have
been cut off on its first appearance. But
when she found that persons into whose
society nothing else could ever have elevated
her, listened to her with reverence,
believed all her ravings, and supplied her
with means and money to spread them
abroad, it is not to be wondered at if she
went on more boldly;—the gainfulness of
the trade soon silencing all doubts of the
truth of her inspiration.</p>

<p>Some of her foremost adherents were
veterans in credulity: they have been initiated
in the mysteries of animal magnetism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
had received spiritual circumcision
from Brothers, and were thus doubly qualified
for the part they were to act in this
new drama of delusion. To accommodate
them, Joanna confirmed the authenticity
of this last fanatic's mission, and acknowledged
him as King of the Hebrews,—but
she dropt his whole mythology. Her
heresy in its main part is not new. The
opinion that redemption extended to men
only and not to women, had been held by
a Norman in the sixteenth century, as
well as by the fair English heretic already
mentioned. This man, in a book called
<i>Virgo Veneta</i>, maintained that a female
Redeemer was necessary for the daughters
of Eve, and announced an old woman of
Venice of his acquaintance as the Saviour
of her sex. Bordonius, a century ago,
broached even a worse heresy. In a work
upon miracles, printed at Parma, he taught
that women did not participate in the
atonement, because they were of a different
species from man, and were incapable of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
eternal life. Joanna and her followers are
too ignorant to be acquainted with these
her prototypes in blasphemy, and the
whole merit of originality in her system
must be allowed her, as indeed she has exceeded
her forerunners in the audacity of
her pretensions. She boldly asserts that she
is the Woman in the Revelations, who has
the Moon under her feet, and on her head
a crown of twelve stars: the twelve stars being
her twelve apostles, who with the second
dozen of believers make up her four-and-twenty
elders. In her visitation it was
told her that the angels rejoiced at her
birth, because she was born to deliver
both men and angels from the insults of
the Devil. Let it be lawful for me to repeat
these blasphemies, holding them up
to merited abhorrence. The scheme of
redemption, she says, is completed in her,
and without her would be imperfect; by
woman came the fall of man, by woman
must come his redemption: woman plucked
the evil fruit, and woman must pluck the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
good fruit; if the Tree of Knowledge was
violated by Eve, the Tree of Life is reserved
for Joanna. Eve was a bone from
Adam, she is a bone from Christ the second
Adam. She is the Bride, the promised
seed who is to bruise the Serpent's
head; she it is who claims the promise
made at the creation, that woman should
be the helpmate of man, and by her the
Creator fulfils that promise, and acquits
himself of the charge of having given to
man the woman in vain. The evening star
was placed in the firmament to be her type.
While she arrogates so much to herself,
she is proportionately liberal to her followers:
they have been appointed to the
four-and-twenty elderships: and to one of
them, when he died, a higher character
was more blasphemously attributed: she
assured his relations, that he was gone to
plead the promises before the Lord; that
to him was to be given the key of the bottomless
pit, and that the time was at hand
when he should be seen descending in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
air,—for they knew not the meaning of
our Saviour's words when he said, "Ye
shall see the Son of Man coming in the
clouds, in power and great glory!"</p>

<p>The immediate object of her call is to
destroy the Devil: of this the Devil was
aware, and that it might not be said he
had had foul play, a regular dispute of
seven days was agreed on between him and
Joanna, in which she was to be alone, and
he to bring with him as many of the
Powers of Darkness as he pleased: but he
was not to appear visibly; for, as he did
not choose to make his appearance on a
former occasion, when some of her elders
went to give him the meeting, but had disappointed
them, he was not to be permitted
to manifest himself bodily now. The
conditions were, that if she held out with
argument against him for seven days, the
Woman should be freed, and he fall; but if
she yielded, Satan's kingdom was to stand,
and a second fall of the human race would
be the consequence. Accordingly, she went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
alone into a solitary house for this conference.
Joanna was her own secretary upon
this occasion, and the process-verbal of the
conference has been printed, as literally
taken down; for she was ordered to set
down all his blasphemies, and show to the
world what the language of Hell is. It is
by no means a polite language;—indeed
the proficiency which Satan displays in
the vulgar tongue is surprising.</p>

<p>Of all Joanna's books this is the most
curious. Satan brought a friend with him,
and they made up a story for themselves
which has some ingenuity. "It is written,"
said they, "Be still, and know that I am
God;" this still worship did not suit Satan;
he was a lively cheerful spirit, full of
mirth and gaiety, which the Lord could
not bear, and therefore cast him out of
Heaven. This, according to Apollyon's
account of Heaven, could have been no
great evil. "Thou knowest," he says, "it
is written of God, he is a consuming fire,
and who can dwell in everlasting burnings?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
Our backs are not brass, nor our sinews
iron, to dwell with God in Heaven." The
Heaven therefore which men mistakingly
desire, is in its nature the very Hell of
which they are so much afraid; and it
is sufficient proof of the truth of all this,
that the Devil invites them to make themselves
happy and lead a gay life, agreeably
to his own cheerful disposition, whereas
religion enjoins self-denial, penitence,
and all things which are contrary to our
natural inclinations. Satan accounted to
Joanna for her inspiration by this solution:
An evil spirit had loved her from her youth
up, he found there was no other access to
her heart than by means of religion; and,
being himself able to foresee future events,
imparted this knowledge to her in the character
of a good spirit. This spirit, he
said, was one which she had been well acquainted
with; it was that of one Mr
Follart, who had told her if she would not
have him for a husband he should die for
her sake, and accordingly he had died.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
But this deception had now been carried
so far that Satan was angry, and threatened,
unless she broke her seals and destroyed
her writings, he would tear her in pieces.</p>

<p>The conference terminated like most
theological disputes. Both parties grew
warm. Apollyon interfered, and endeavoured
to accommodate matters, but without
effect, and Joanna talked Satan out of
all patience. She gave him, as he truly
complained, ten words for one, and allowed
him no time to speak. All men,
he said, were tired of her tongue already,
and now she had tired the Devil. This
was not unreasonable; but he proceeded
to abuse the whole sex, which would have
been ungracious in any one, and in him
was ungrateful. He said no man could
tame a woman's tongue—the sands of an
hour-glass did not run faster—it was better
to dispute with a thousand men than
one woman. After this dispute she fasted
forty days; but this fast, which is regarded
by her believers as so miraculous, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
merely a Catholic Lent, in which she abstained
from fish as well as flesh.</p>

<p>The Moon which is under her feet in the
Revelations, typifies the Devil: for the
moon, it seems, having power to give light
by night but not by day, is Satan's kingdom,
and his dwelling-place; he, I conclude,
being the very person commonly
called the Man in the Moon; a conjecture
of my own, which, you must allow, is
strongly confirmed by his horns. Once,
when the Lord made her the same promise
as Herod had done to Herodias, she requested
that Satan might be cut off from
the face of the earth as John the Baptist
had been. This petition she was instructed
to write, and seal it with three seals, and
carry it to the altar when she received the
sacrament! and a promise was returned
that it should be granted. Her dreams are
usually of the Devil. Once she saw him
like a pig with his mouth tied; at another
time skinned his face with her nails after
a fierce battle; once she bit off his fingers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
and thought the blood sweet,—and once
she dreamt she had fairly killed him. But
neither has the promise of his destruction
been as yet fulfilled, nor the dream accomplished.</p>

<p>This phrensy would have been speedily
cured in our country; bread and water, a
solitary cell, and a little wholesome discipline
are specifics in such cases. Mark the
difference in England. No bishop interferes;
she therefore boldly asserts that she
has the full consent of the bishops to declare
that her call is from God, because,
having been called upon to disprove it, they
keep silent. She who was used to earn her
daily bread by daily labour, is now taken
into the houses of her wealthy believers, regarded
as the most blessed among women,
carried from one part of England to another,
and treated every where with reverence
little less than idolatry. Meantime
dictating books as fast as her scribes can
write them down, she publishes them as fast
as they are written, and the Joannians buy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
them as fast as they are published. Nor
is this her only trade. The seals in the
Revelations furnished her with a happy
hint. She calls upon all persons "to sign
their names for Christ's glorious and peaceable
kingdom to be established, and to
come upon earth, and his will to be done
on earth as it is done in heaven, and for
Satan's kingdom to be destroyed, which is
the prayer and desire of Joanna Southcott."
They who sign this are to be sealed.
Now if this temporal sealing, which is
mentioned by St John in the Revelations,
had been understood before this time, men
would have begun sealing themselves without
the visitation of the spirit; and if she
had not understood it and explained it now,
it would have been more fatal for herself
and for all mankind than the fall of Eve
was. The mystery of sealing is this: whosoever
signs his name receives a sealed letter
containing these words: <i>The Sealed of
the Lord, the Elect, Precious, Man's Redemption,
to inherit the Tree of Life, to be</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
<i>made Heirs of God, and Joint-heirs with
Jesus Christ.</i> Signed <i>Joanna Southcott</i>. I
know not what the price of this initiation
is; but she boasts of having sealed above
eight thousand persons, so that the trade
is a thriving one.</p>

<p>And these things are believed in England!
in England, where Catholic Christians
are so heartily despised for superstition;
in England, where the people think themselves
so highly enlightened,—in this country
of reason and philosophy, and free enquiry!
It is curious to observe how this
age in which we live is denominated by
every writer just as its temper accords with
his own views: with the Infidel, it is the
Age of Reason; with the Churchman, the
Age of Infidelity; with the Chemist, the
Age of Philosophy; with Rulers, the Age
of Anarchy; with the People, the Age of
Oppression,—every one beholding the prospect
through a coloured glass, and giving
it sunshine or shade, frost or verdure, according
to his own fancy, none looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
round him, and seeing it fairly as it is. Yet
surely if we consider the ignorance of the
great majority of the English, the want of
anchorage for their faith, the want of able
directors for their souls, the rapidity with
which novelties of any kind are circulated
throughout the country, the eagerness with
which the credulous listen to every new
blasphemy, the contemptuous indifference
of the clergy to any blasphemy, provided it
does not immediately threaten themselves,
the unlimited toleration shown to Jews,
Gentiles, and Heretics of every description,—above
all, if we remember that every
person has the power of comparing these
delusive books with the Bible, of which
they are instructed to consider themselves
competent expounders,—we must acknowledge
that there never was any age or
any country so favourable to the success
of imposture, and the growth of superstition,
as this very age and this very
England.</p>

<p>I have to add concerning Joanna, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
she prophesies how she and her believers
are to be tried in the ensuing year, and that
this awful trial will be only second to that
of our blessed Lord at Pilate's bar! What
new juggle is in preparation I pretend not
to divine. Thus much is certain, that her
believers are proof against conviction, and
you will agree with me in thinking no further
trial necessary to prove that she and
her abettors ought either to be punished
as impostors, or silenced as lunatics.<span class="fnanchor"><a

The Translator has been curious enough to enquire
the event of this trial, which may be related in
few words. None but her believers assembled; they
provided an attorney to give their proceedings some
of the ceremonials of legality, examined witnesses to
prove the good character of the prophetess, signed a
profession of belief in her,—and afterwards published
an account of all this folly under the title of The
Trial of Joanna Southcott. Joanna had predicted that
at this trial she was to be cast into a trance;—not
thinking this convenient when the time appointed
came, she had a revelation to say, that if any of her
judges required it, the Lord would still entrance her,
but that it would certainly be her death: and thus
throwing herself upon the mercy of her own accomplices,
it will easily be guessed that none among them
insisted upon the proof. One of the company enquired
whether Satan knew he was cast by this trial; as, in
that case, it was to be presumed he would rage
against her and her friends with the utmost of his
fury. This gentleman would have been a good subject
for a night-mare.</p>

<p class="nodent">What follows is in the words of one of her chosen
disciples:—"On Monday morning Joanna received
a letter from Exeter, which informed her she would
have Mr Jones's answer about Mr Pomeroy in the
evening; and her fears for him flung her into a violent
agitation; every nerve in her shook, and she
fell sick as though she would have fainted away. She
could not keep in her bed, but laid herself on the
floor in agonies, and said she knew not whether to
pity or condemn him; but at last got up in a rage
against the Devil, and said her revenge would be
sweet to see the Devil chained down, and she should
like, with a sharp sword to cut him in pieces. She
then got into bed, exclaiming against the clergy, and
asked for a glass of wine; but she brought it up immediately.
Soon after the bason was set upon the
bed, she took it up and dashed it violently across the
room, and broke it to pieces. After that she had
some lamb brought up for her dinner; she tried to
swallow a mouthful but could not, but spit it into
another bason, and said she could neither swallow
the wine nor the lamb, but found the fury of the Lord
break in upon her, and she dashed the second bason
on the floor. She then said she felt herself happier
and easier since she had broken both the basons; for
so would the Lord, in his anger, break the clergy."</p>

<p class="nodent">A few flowers of infernal eloquence should be added
from The Dispute with the Powers of Darkness.
Satan says to her, "Thou infamous b—ch! thou hast
been flattering God that he may stand thy friend.
Such low cunning art I despise.—Thou wheening
devil! stop thy d—mn'd eternal tongue; thou runnest
on so fast all the Devils in Hell cannot keep up
with thee.—God hath done something to chuse a
b—ch of a woman that will down-argue the Devil,
and scarce give him room to speak."—It may truly
be said, in Joanna's own words, "<i>If the woman is
not ashamed of herself, the Devil cannot shame her</i>."</p>

<p class="nodent">If the language of Joanna herself is grovelling in
the very mud and mire of baseness and vulgarity, one
of her elders has soared into the sublime of frenzy.
The passage is long, but deserves insertion, as, perhaps,
there does not exist elsewhere so complete a
specimen of a prophet rampant. The gentleman
begins in some plain prose reflections upon the Fall,
and goes on addressing the Devil, till he has worked
himself up, and begins thus to rave in rhythm.</p>

<p class="nodent">"—Then where's thy ground on earth? receive
thy doom, the pit, there twist in flames, and there

to carry peace to all.—The Ark is opened now, she
brings the olive branch,—the floods are past, where's
now the giant race?—Who pressed on Lot? 'Twas
thee the proud oppressor! Where art thou now?—Where
is thy pride and city? Knowest thou the
words, come out! come out! let Sodom feel its doom.
Where now is Lot? At Zoar safe! Where is his
wife? Is she not salt all?—The writing's on the
wall.—Thou lewdly revellest with the bowls of God.—Thy
kingdom's past away—Now see my Daniel
rise—Who cast him in the den?—'Twas thee—Thou
rolledst the stone, thou sealedst his doom—the
roaring Lion thee! Then let the stone return,
the seal be broke, and go thou in his stead. Where
is the image gold and Bel? Where is proud Babel's
builder? Confusion is thy name: confusion is thy
doom! Let Bel asunder burst! the pitch, and tar,
and walls of wood expose thy make, deceit and craft,
and pass in flames away. The God of Daniel stands—Daniel,
rise up!—Six days are past—the seventh now
is here—seven times refined and purified—in innocency
come.—The emerald, unhurt in fire, displays
great Judah's son.—Let Urim's Light and Thummim
shine in bright perfection's day. The twelve men
stand upon the plate—the fourth denotes great Judah's
son, who is the rightful heir. The stones denote
old Jacob's sons, their light and quality—they
shine as stars in Jesus' crown upon the Woman's
head.—The sun unveil'd shall now arise—The Moon
from scarlet shall emerge—The stars from darkness
now appear to light the midnight hour—Then where
art thou, O Satan! Where are thy heads, and horns,
and dragon's tail, which slew and hurt the living stars?
Where are thy rays of fire—thy watery floods—behold
they are past away—The woman's fears of thee
are o'er—the wilderness receives her child, whose
iron rod now feel. The pit has oped its mouth—thou
now art cast, shut up and sealed—the saints
now judge the earth. The Omnipotent is here in
power and spirit in the word—The sword, white
horse, and King of Kings has drawn the flaming
sword! Rejoice, ye saints, rejoice! The Beast and
Dragon, mountain, tree, no more shall hurt, devour,
becloud, the Saint, the gold, and vine. The gold
and gems appear—The mighty earthquake now displays
the hidden Son of God. The rod and smitten
rock gush forth, and smite and slay, and make alive,
now saves and now destroys. The cloud and glory,
Jonah's sign, display the virtues of the word, the
light and darkness shews. The Gospel brings the
light, and life, and death—and death as men obey
or mock. The six denotes the suffering time to
shew the Son of Man—The sign within the Sun—The
fowls now feast on thee! Then where's thy
former reign? Beneath the rod of Moses see thy
fall from Heaven's height. Son of the Morning,
Lucifer, no more oppress—be thou a fallen star!
Great Gog and Agag, where are ye? The walls of
Jericho art thou; fall flat! Joshua's ram's horns,
the seven and twelve, pass Jordan's stream.—Where
is the Lion, Bear, Goliath huge, but in the centre
thee. David appears, a stripling youth, now tears,
and slays, and slings the stone, and smites thy dragon's
head. Now see great David's reign—The
temple's stones, unhewed by man in those days,
unite, the King of Peace amidst the seven in oil
unite, and in a stone with seven eyes appears. The
stately fabric now is laid, founded and topped with
gems of every hue. The ark of Moses now is built—The
words, the laws, the sceptre, all unite, and
Aaron's budded rod—He now is chosen; eat the
bread, prepare the sacrifice. John eats the book
which sweet and bitter is—He prophesies; the temple
metes, and stands before the Lamb. The temple
measures, and anoints, and Moses's tabernacle. The
witnesses, Matthew and John, as olive trees appear.—The
broken stones of Moses now uplift, renewed
in books arise from death—The Lord's anointed
reigns—The rods, or laws, of Ephraim ten, unite in
one and hold by Judah's skirt—The Son of Man
o'er Israel reigns—The dry bones now arise—Here
ends thy earthly reign—The bond of union now is
come—The marriage ring appears—The Bride is
come—The Bridegroom now receives the marriage
seal—The Law and Gospel now unite—The Moon
and Sun appear—Caleb and Joshua pass the stream
in triumph to restore. Where now, thou Canaanite,
art thou? Where all thy maddened crew?—</p>

<p>There is however no country in which
there are so many varieties of the animal
as in England, none where he flourishes
so successfully, makes such heroic endeavours
for notoriety, and enjoys so wide a
sphere of it.</p>

<p>The highest order is that of those who
have invented for themselves the happy
title of Fashionables. These gentlemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
stand highest in the scale of folly, and
lowest in that of intellect, of any in the
country, inasmuch as the rivalry between
them is which shall excel his competitors
in frivolity. There was a man in England
half a century ago well known for this
singular kind of insanity, that he believed
his soul had been annihilated within him,
while he was yet living. What this poor
maniac conceived to have been done by
his soul, these gentlemen have successfully
accomplished for themselves with
their intellect. Their souls might be
lodged in a nutshell without incommoding
the maggot who previously tenanted it;
and if the whole stock of their ideas were
transferred to the maggot, they would not
be sufficient to confuse his own. It is
impossible to describe them, because no
idea can be formed of infinite littleness:
you might as reasonably attempt to dissect
a bubble, or to bottle moonshine, as to
investigate their characters: they prove
satisfactorily the existence of a vacuum:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
the sum total of their being is composed
of negative quantities.</p>

<p>One degree above or below these are the
fops who appear in a tangible shape; they
who prescribe fashions to the tailor, that
the tailor may prescribe them to the town;
who decide upon the length of a neck-handkerchief,
and regulate the number of
buttons at the knees of their breeches. One
person has attained the very summit of
ambition by excelling all others in the jet
varnish of his boots. Infinite are the exertions
which have been made to equal him,—the
secret of projection could not be more
eagerly desired than the receipt of his
blacking; and there is one competitor
whose boots are allowed to approach very
near to the same point of perfection;—still
they only approach it. This meritorious
rival loses the race of fame by half a neck,
and in such contests it is <i>aut Cæsar, aut
nihil</i>. To have the best blacked boots in
the world, is a worthy object of successful
emulation,—but to have only the second-best,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
is to be Pompey in the Pharsalia of
Fashion.</p>

<p>During one period of the French Revolution
the Brutus head-dress was the mode,
though Brutus was at the same time considered
as the Judas Iscariot of political
religion, being indeed at this day to an
orthodox Anti-Jacobin what Omar is to
the Persians; that is, something a great
deal worse than the Devil. "I suppose,
sir," said a London hair-dresser to a gentleman
from the country,—"I suppose,
sir, you would like to be dressed in the
Brutus style." "What style is that?" was
the question in reply. "All over frizzley,
sir, like the Negers,—They be Brutes you
know." If Apollo be the model of the day,
these gentlemen wear stays; if Hercules,
the tailor supplies breasts of buckram,
broad shoulders, and brawny arms. At
present, as the soldiers from Egypt have
brought home with them broken limbs
and ophthalmia, they carry an arm in a
sling, or walk the streets with a green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
shade over the eyes. Every thing now
must be Egyptian: the ladies wear crocodile
ornaments, and you sit upon a sphinx
in a room hung round with mummies,
and with the long black lean-armed long-nosed
hieroglyphical men, who are enough
to make the children afraid to go to bed.
The very shopboards must be metamorphosed
into the mode, and painted in
Egyptian letters, which, as the Egyptians
had no letters, you will doubtless conceive
must be curious. They are simply the
common characters, deprived of all beauty
and all proportion by having all the strokes
of equal thickness, so that those which
should be thin look as if they had the elephantiasis.</p>

<p>Men are tempted to make themselves
notorious in England by the ease with
which they succeed. The newspapers, in
the dearth of matter for filling their daily
columns, are glad to insert any thing,—when
one lady comes to town, when another
leaves it, when a third expects her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
<i>accouchement</i>; the grand dinner of one
gentleman, and the grand supper of another
are announced before they take place;
the particulars are given after the action,
a list of the company inserted, the parties
who danced together exhibited like the
characters of a drama in an English bill of
the play, and the public are informed what
dances were called for, and by whom.
There is something so peculiarly elegant
and appropriate in the names of the fashionable
dances, that it is proper to give
you a specimen. Moll in the Wad is one;—you
must excuse me for not translating
this, for really I do not understand it.
Drops of Brandy, another; and two
which are at present in high vogue are,
The Devil among the Tailors, and Go
to the Devil and shake yourself. At these
balls, the floors are chalked in colours
in carpet patterns, a hint taken from the
lame beggars who write their petitions
upon the flag-stones in the street. This is
so excellently done, that one should think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
it would be painful to trample on and destroy
any thing so beautiful, even though
only made to be destroyed. These things
indicate the same sort of want of feeling
as the ice-palaces of Russia, and the statue
of snow made by Michel Angelo at Pietro
de Medici's command. We are surrounded
in this world with what is perishable,
that we may be taught to set our hearts
and hopes upon the immutable and everlasting;—it
is ill done, then, to make perishableness
the food of pride.</p>

<p>The system of visiting in high life is
brought to perfection in this country.
Were a lady to call in person upon all the
numerous acquaintance whom she wishes
sometimes to crowd together at her Grand
Parties, her whole time would be too little
to go from door to door. This, therefore,
being confessedly impossible, the
card-currency of etiquette was issued,
and the name dropt by a servant, allowed
to have the same saving virtue of civility
as the real presence. But the servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
began to find this a hard duty, and found
out that they were working like postmen
without any necessity for so doing; so
they agreed at last to meet at certain pot-houses,
and exchange cards, or leave them
there as at a post-office, where each in turn
calls to deposit all with which he is charged,
and to receive all which are designed
for him.</p>

<p>I have spoken elsewhere of the Turf,
a road to fame always, and oftentimes to
ruin; but for this so large a fortune is
required, that the famous must always be
few. A man, however, of moderate, or of
no fortune, may acquire great glory by
riding a score of horses almost or quite to
death, for the sake of showing in how
short a time he can go fifty leagues.
Others, with a nobler ambition, delight in
displaying their own speed. I know not
whether Christoval de Mesa would have
said of this sort of walking or of running,
as he did of the game of <i>pelota</i>:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse indent2">Es el que mas a la virtud se llega,</div>
<div class="verse">que ni entorpece, ni el ingenio embota,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">antes da ligereza y exercita,</div>
<div class="verse">y pocos que la juegan tienen gota.<span class="fnanchor"><a
     name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>I know not whether he would have said
this of their exercise; but this I know, that
some of the English gentlemen would
make the best running footmen in the
world.</p>

<p>Another school—to borrow a term from
the Philosophers—is that of the Amateurs
of Boxing, who call themselves <i>the Fancy</i>.
They attend the academies of the two
great professors Jackson and Mendoza,
the Aristotle and Plato of pugilism,—bring
up youths of promise from the country to
be trained, and match them according to
their wind, science, and bottom. But I
am writing to the uninitiated,—bottom
means courage, that sort of it which will
endure a great deal. Too much vivacity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
is rather against a man; if he indulges in
any flourishes or needless gesticulations he
wastes his wind, and though he may be admitted
to be <i>a pleasant fighter</i>, this is considered
as a disadvantage. When the
champion comes off victor, after suffering
much in the contest, he is said to be <i>much
punished</i>. There is something to be attended
to besides science, which is the
body: it is expedient to swallow raw eggs
for the wind, and to feed upon beef as
nearly raw as possible: they who do this,
and practise with weights in their hands,
are said to <i>cultivate the muscles</i>. Upon
the brutality of this amusement I have already
said something, nor is it needful to
comment upon what is so apparent;—but
it is just that I should now state what may
truly be said in its defence. It is alleged,
that in consequence of this custom, no
people decide their quarrels with so little
injury to each other as the English. The
Dutch slice each other with their snickersnees;
we know how deadly the knife is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
employed in our country;—the American
twists the hair of his enemy round his
thumb, and scoops out an eye with his
finger;—but in England a boxing-match
settles all disputes among the lower classes,
and when it is over they shake hands, and
are friends. Another equally beneficial
effect is the security afforded to the weaker
by the laws of honour, which forbid all
undue advantages; the man who should
aim a blow below the waist, who should
kick his antagonist, strike him when he is
down, or attempt to injure him after he
had yielded, would be sure to experience
the resentment of the mob, who, on such
occasions, always assemble to see what
they call fair play, which they enforce as
rigidly as the Knights of the Round Table
did the laws of chivalry.</p>

<p>The next persons to be noticed are those
who seek notoriety by more respectable
means; but, following wise pursuits foolishly,
live in a sort of intellectual limbo
between the worlds of Wisdom and Folly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
The fashionable agriculturists are of this
class: men who assume, as the creed of
their philosophical belief, a foolish saying
of some not very wise author, "That he
who makes two blades of grass grow where
only one grew before, is the greatest benefactor
to his species." With these persons,
the noblest employment of human intellect
is to improve the size of turnips and cabbages,
and for this they lay aside all other
studies. "When my friends come to see
me in the summer," said one of these gentlemen,
"I like to hear them complain
that they have not been able to sleep in
their beds for heat, because then I know
things are growing out of doors." <i>Quicquid
amat valde amat</i>, may truly be said
of the Englishman; his pursuit always
becomes his passion; and, if great follies
are oftentimes committed in consequence
of this ardour, it must not be forgotten that
it leads also to great actions, and to important
public benefits.</p>

<p>Of this class the breeders are the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
remarkable, and least useful. Their object
is to improve the cattle of the country,
for which purpose they negotiate with the
utmost anxiety the amours of their cows
and sheep. Such objects, exclusively pursued,
tend little to improve either the intellect
or the manners:—these people will
apply to a favourite pig, or a Herefordshire
bull, the same epithets of praise and exclamations
of delight, which a sculptor
would bestow upon the Venus de Medici,
or the Apollo Belvidere. This passion is
carried to an incredible degree of folly:
the great object of ambition is to make the
animal as fat as possible, by which means
it is diseased and miserable while it lives,
and of no use to any but the tallow-chandler
when dead. At this very time there is
a man in London belonging to a fat ox,
who has received more money for having
fattened this ox than Newton obtained for
all his discoveries, or Shakspeare for all
his works. Crowds go to see the monster,
which is a shapeless mass of living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
fat. A picture has been painted both of
man and beast, a print engraved from it in
order that the one may be immortalized as
the fattest ox that ever was seen, and the
other, as the man that fed him to that
size; and two thousand persons have subscribed
for this at a guinea each. A fat
pig has been set up against him, which, I
know not why, does not seem to take. The
pig is acknowledged to be a pig of great
merit, but he is in a manner neglected,
and his man complains of the want of taste
in the public.</p>

<p>To end the list of fashions, what think
you of philosophy in fashion? You must
know that though the wise men of old
could find out no royal road to the mathematics,
in England they have been more
ingenious, and have made many short cuts
to philosophy for the accommodation of
ladies and gentlemen. The arts and
sciences are now taught in lectures to fashionable
audiences of both sexes; and
there is a Royal Institution for this purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
where some of the most scientific
men in the kingdom are thus unworthily
employed. I went there one morning with
J. and his wife,—whom you are not to
suspect of going for any other purpose
than to see the place. Part of the men
were taking snuff to keep their eyes open,
others more honestly asleep, while the ladies
were all upon the watch, and some
score of them had their tablet and pencils,
busily noting down what they heard, as
topics for the next conversation party.
"Oh!" said J. when he came out, in a tone
which made it half groan half interjection,
"the days of tapestry hangings and
worked chair-bottoms were better days
than these!—I will go and buy for Harriet
the Whole Duty of Woman, containing
the complete Art of Cookery."</p>

<p>But even oxygen and hydrogen are not
subjects sufficiently elevated for all. Mind
and matter, free will and necessity, are
also fashionable topics of conversation;
and you shall hear the origin of ideas explained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
the nature of volition elucidated,
and the extent of space and the duration
of time discussed over a tea-table with admirable
volubility. Nay, it is well if one
of these orators does not triumphantly
show you that there is nothing but misery
in the world, prove that you must either
limit the power of God or the goodness,
and then modestly leave you to determine
which. Another effect this of the general
passion for distinction: the easiest way
of obtaining access into literary society,
and getting that kind of notoriety, is by
professing to be a metaphysician, because
of such metaphysics a man may get as
much in half an hour as in his whole
life.</p>

<p>At present the English philosophers and
politicians, both male and female, are in a
state of great alarm. It has been discovered
that the world is over-peopled, and
that it always must be so, from an error
in the constitution of nature; that the law
which says "Increase and multiply," was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
given without sufficient consideration; in
short, that He who made the world does
not know how to manage it properly, and
therefore there are serious thoughts of requesting
the English Parliament to take
the business out of his hands.</p>

<h2>LETTER LXXII.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>Westminster Abbey on Fire.—Frequency of
Fires in England.—Means devised for
preventing and for extinguishing them;
but not in Use.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">I</span> <span class="smc">was</span>
fortunate enough this morning to
witness a very grand and extraordinary
sight. As D. and I were walking towards
the west end of the town, we met an acquaintance
who told us that Westminster
Abbey was on fire. We lost no time in
going to the spot; the roof was just smoking
sufficiently to show us that the intelligence
was true, but that the building was
no longer in danger.</p>

<p>The crowd which had collected was by
no means so great as we had expected.—Soldiers
were placed at the doors to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
out idle intruders, and admit such only as
might properly be admitted. The sight when
we entered was truly striking. Engines were
playing in the church, and the long leathern
pipes which conveyed the water stretched
along the pavement. The roof at the joint
of the cross, immediately over the choir,
had fallen in, and the huge timbers lay
black and smoking, in heaps, upon the
pews which they had crushed. A pulpit,
of fine workmanship, stood close by unhurt.
Smaller fragments, and sparks of
fire, were from time to time falling down;
and the water which was still spouted up
in streams, fell in showers, and hissed
upon the hot ruins below. We soon perceived
that no real injury was done to the
church, though considerable damage was
inflicted upon the funds of the chapter.—The
part which was thus consumed had
not been finished like the rest of the building;
instead of masonry, it had been from
some paltry motives of parsimony made of
wood, and lined on the inside with painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
canvas, in a miserable style. All this
patchwork was now destroyed, as it deserved
to be; and the light coming in from
above, slanted on the fretted roof, the
arches and pillars, which stood unhurt and
perfectly secure.</p>

<p>The Westminster boys were working an
engine in the cloisters with hearty goodwill.
D., who had been educated at Westminster
himself, said they were glad at the
fire; indeed, he confessed that he did not
himself look without satisfaction upon the
ruins of the pew, where he had formerly
been compelled to sit so many hours in the
cold.</p>

<p>The pavement in that part of the abbey
which is called Poet's Corner sunk considerably
in consequence of the water, the
earth in the graves probably sinking when
wet: so much so that the stones must be
taken up and laid anew. What an opportunity
of examining the skulls of so many
celebrated men! If professor Blumenbach
were but an Englishman, or if the dean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
and chapter were physiologists, these relics
would now be collected and preserved.</p>

<p>One of the graves would exhibit curious
contents, if any such curiosity should be
indulged. An old countess, who died not
long since after a very singular life, gave
orders in her will that she should be buried
in Poets' Corner, as near as possible to
Shakspeare's monument, dressed in her
wedding suit, and with a speaking trumpet
in her coffin. These orders her executors
were obliged to perform to the letter.
Accordingly, a grave was solicited and
granted for a due consideration in this
holy ground; the old lady was equipped
in her bridal array, packed up for the journey,
and ready to set off, when it was discovered
that the speaking-trumpet had been
forgotten. What was to be done? This
was in a remote part of the country; there
was not such a thing to be purchased within
a dozen leagues, and the will was not
to be trifled with. Luckily some person
there present recollected that a gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
in the neighbourhood had a speaking-trumpet,
which had been left him by a sea-captain
as a memorial of an old friend, and
which for that reason he particularly valued.
A messenger was immediately dispatched
to borrow this; of course he was
careful not to say for what it was wanted:
as soon as it was brought, it was put by her
side in the coffin, the coffin was soldered
down, off posted the funeral for London,
and if the rightful owner does not look
after his trumpet now, he will have no
other opportunity till he hears the old lady
flourish upon it at the resurrection, for
which purpose it is to be presumed, she
chose to have it at hand.</p>

<p>This mischief, which might have been
in its consequences so deplorable, was occasioned
by the carelessness of some
plumbers, who were at work upon the
roof. Old St Paul's was destroyed just
in this way: it is surprising how many
accidents of this kind have happened from
the same cause, and provoking to think,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
that so great and venerable a work of piety
and human genius, and human power,
should have been so near destruction by
the stupid negligence of a common labourer!
They burn in the hand for accidental
homicide in this country;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span> a little
application of hot iron for accidental
church-burning would be a punishment in
kind for a neglect of duty, so dangerous,
that it ought not to be unpunished. When
carelessness endangers the life or welfare
of another, it ought to be regarded as a
crime.</p>

<p>A fire is the only ordinary spectacle in
this great metropolis which I have not seen;
for this cannot be called such, though in
its effect finer than any conflagration.—Fires
are so frequently happening, that I
may consider myself as unfortunate. The
traveller who is at London without seeing
a fire, and at Naples without witnessing an
eruption of Vesuvius, is out of luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
The danger of fire is one to which the
Londoners are more exposed than any people
in the world, except, perhaps, the inhabitants
of Constantinople. Their earth-coal
must be considered as one main cause—pieces
of this are frequently exploded
into the room. The carelessness of servants
is another; for nothing but candles
are used to give light for domestic purposes,
and accidents happen from a candle
which could not from a lamp. The accumulation
of furniture in an English house
is so much fuel in readiness; all the floors
are boarded, all the bedsteads are of wood,
all the beds have curtains. I have heard
of a gentleman who set the tail of his shirt
on fire as he was stepping into bed, the
flames caught the curtains, and the house
was consumed. You may easily suppose
this adventure obtained for him the name
of The Comet.</p>

<p>Means have been devised for preventing
fires, for extinguishing them, and for
escaping from them. David Hartley, son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
to a great English philosopher of the same
name, proposed to line every room with
plates of metal, and Lord Stanhope invented
a kind of mortar for the same purpose.
Both methods have been tried with
complete success; but they will never be
adopted unless a law be passed to compel
the adoption. For houses in London, and
indeed in all large towns, are built for sale,
and the builder will not incur the expense
of making them fire-proof, because, if they
are burnt, he is not the person who is to be
burnt in them. And if he who builds for
himself in the country, were disposed to
avail himself of these inventions, should
he have heard of them, the difficulty of
instructing labourers in the use of any
thing which they have not been used to,
is such, that rather than attempt it, he
submits to the same hazard as his neighbours.</p>

<p>You would suppose, however, that there
could be no objection to the use of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
means for extinguishing fires. Balls for
this purpose were invented by Mr Godfrey,
son to the inventor of a famous quack-medicine;
but the son's fire-balls did not
succeed so well as the father's cordial.—Succeed,
indeed, they did, in effecting
what was intended; for, when one of
them was thrown into a room which
had been filled with combustibles and set
on fire for the purpose of experiment, it
exploded, and instantly quenched it.
But there was an objection to the use of
these balls which Mr Godfrey had not
foreseen. It is a trade in England to put
out fires, and the English have a proverb
that "All trades must live;" which is so
thoroughly admitted by all ranks and
degrees, that if the elixir of life were
actually to be discovered, the furnishers
of funerals would present a petition to
parliament, praying that it might be prohibited,
in consideration of the injury
they must otherwise sustain; and in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
probability, parliament would permit their
plea. The continuance of the slave trade,
in consideration of the injury which the
dealers in human flesh would sustain by
its abolishment, would be a precedent. The
firemen made a conspiracy against Godfrey;
and when he or any of his friends attended
at a fire, and mounted a ladder to
throw the balls in, the ladder was always
thrown down; so that, as the life of every
person who attempted to use them was thus
endangered, the thing was given up.</p>

<p>The machine for escaping is a sort of
iron basket, or chair, fixed in a groove on
the outside of the house. I have never
seen one at any other place than at the
inventor's warehouse. The poet, Gray,
was notoriously fearful of fire, and kept
a ladder of ropes in his bed-room. Some
mischievous young men at Cambridge
knew this, and roused him from below,
in the middle of a dark night, with the
cry of Fire! The staircase, they said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
was in flames. Up went his window,
and down he came by his rope-ladder,
as fast as he could go, into a tub of
water which they had placed to receive
him.</p>

<h2>LETTER LXXIII.</h2>

<p class="gist center"><i>Remarks on the English Language.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">H</span><span class="smc">e</span>
who ventures to criticise a foreign
language should bear in mind that he is
in danger of exposing his own ignorance.
"What a vile language is yours!" said a
Frenchman to an Englishman;—"you
have the same word for three different
things! There is ship, <i>un vaisseau</i>; ship
(sheep) <i>mouton</i>; and ship (cheap) <i>bon
marché</i>."—Now these three words, so happily
instanced by Monsieur, are pronounced
as differently as they are spelt. As I see
his folly, it will be less excusable should I
commit the same myself.</p>

<p>The English is rather a hissing than a
harsh language, and perhaps this was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
characteristic to which Charles V. alluded,
when he said it was fit to speak to birds
in. It has no gutturals like ours, no
nasal twang like the Portugueze and
French; but the perpetual sibilance is very
grating. If the Rabbis have not discovered
in what language the Serpent tempted
Eve, they need not look beyond the English;
it has the true mark of his enunciation.
I think this characteristic of the
language may be accounted for by the character
of the nation. They are an active
busy people, who like to get through what
they are about with the least possible delay,
and if two syllables can be shortened
into one it is so much time saved. What
we do with <i>Vmd.</i> they have done with half
the words in their language. They have
squeezed the vowel out of their genitives
and plurals, and compressed dissyllables
into monosyllables. The French do the
same kind of thing in a worse way; they
in speaking leave half of every word behind
them in a hurry; the English pack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
up theirs close, and hasten on with the
whole.</p>

<p>It is a concise language, though the
grievous want of inflections necessitates a
perpetual use of auxiliaries. It would be
difficult to fill eight lines of English, adhering
closely to the sense, with the translation
of an octave stanza. Their words
are shorter; and though in many cases
they must use two and sometimes three,
where we need but one, still if the same
meaning requires more words, it is contained
in fewer syllables, and costs less
breath. Weight for weight, a pound of
<i>garvanzos</i><span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span> will lie in half the compass of
a pound of chesnuts.</p>

<p>Frenchmen always pronounce English
ill; Germans, better; it is easier for a
Spaniard than for either. The <i>th</i>, or
theta, is their shibboleth; our <i>z</i> has so
nearly the same sound that we find little
or no difficulty in acquiring it. In fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
the pronunciation would not be difficult
if it were not capricious; but the exceptions
to any general rule are so numerous,
that years and years of practice are hardly
sufficient to acquire them. Neither is the
pronunciation of the same word alike at
all times, for it sometimes becomes the
fashion to change the accent. The theatre
gives the law in these cases. What
can have been the cause of this preposterous
and troublesome irregularity is beyond
my knowledge. They acknowledge
the defect, and many schemes have been
devised by speculative writers for improving
the orthography, and assimilating it to
the oral tongue: but they have all so disfigured
the appearance of the language,
and so destroyed all visible traces of etymology,
that they have only excited ridicule,
and have deserved nothing better.</p>

<p>It is difficult to acquire, yet far less so
than the German and its nearer dialects;
the syntax is less involved, and the proportion
of Latin words far greater. Dr Johnson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
their lexicographer, and the most
famous of all their late writers, introduced
a great number of sesquipedalian Latinisms,
like our Latinists of the seventeenth
century. The ladies complain of this, and
certainly it was done in a false taste,—but
it facilitates a foreigner's progress. I find
Johnson for this very reason the easiest
English author; his long words are always
good stepping-stones, on which I get sure
footing.</p>

<p>If the size of his dictionary, which is
the best and largest, may be regarded as
a criterion, the language is not copious.
We must not however forget that dictionaries
profess to give only the written language,
and that hundreds and thousands
of words, either preserved by the peasantry
in remote districts, or created by the
daily wants and improvements of society,
by ignorance or ingenuity, by whim or by
wit, never find their way into books,
though they become sterling currency.
But that it is not copious may be proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
by a few general remarks. The verb and
substantive are often the same; they have
few diminutives and no augmentatives;
and their derivatives are few. You know
how many we have from <i>agua</i>; the English
have only one from <i>water</i>, which is the adjective
<i>watery</i>; and to express the meaning
of ours, they either use the simple verb
in different senses, or form some composite
in the clumsy Dutch way of sticking two
words together; <i>agua</i>, water; <i>aguaza</i>,
water; <i>aguar</i>, to water; <i>hazer aguada</i>, to
water; <i>aguadero</i>, a water-man; <i>aguaducho</i>,
a water-pipe; <i>aguado</i>, a water-drinker,
&amp;c. &amp;c. And yet, notwithstanding
these deficiencies, they tell me it is truly a
rich language. Corinthian brass would
not be an unapt emblem for it,—materials
base and precious melted down into a compound
still precious, though debased.</p>

<p>They have one name for an animal in
English, and another for its flesh;—for
instance, cow-flesh is called beef; that of
the sheep, mutton; that of the pig, pork.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
The first is of Saxon, the latter of French
origin; and this seems to prove that meat
cannot have been the food of the poor in
former times. The cookery books retain
a technical language from the days when
carving was a science, and instruct the
reader to <i>cut up</i> a turkey, to <i>rear</i> a goose,
to <i>wing</i> a partridge, to <i>thigh</i> a woodcock,
to <i>unbrace</i> a duck, to <i>unlace</i> a rabbit, to
<i>allay</i> a pheasant, to <i>display</i> a crane, to
<i>dismember</i> a hern, and to <i>lift</i> a swan.</p>

<p>Their early writers are intelligible to none
but the learned, whereas a child can understand
the language of the Partidas, though
a century anterior to the oldest English
work. This late improvement is easily
explained by their history: they were a
conquered people: the languages of the
lord and the subject were different; and it
was some ages before that of the people
was introduced at court, and into the law
proceedings, and that not till it had become
so amalgamated with the Norman
French, as in fact to be no longer Saxon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
We, on the contrary, though we lost the
greater part of our country, never lost our
liberty—nor our mother tongue. What
Arabic we have we took from our slaves,
not our masters.</p>

<p>I can discover, but not discriminate, provincial
intonations, and sometimes provincial
accentuation; but the peculiar words,
or phrases, or modes of speech which characterize
the different parts of the country,
a foreigner cannot perceive. The only
written dialect is the Scotch. It differs
far more from English than Portugueze
from Castilian, nearly as much as the Catalan,
though the articles and auxiliars are
the same. Very many words are radically
different, still more so differently pronounced
as to retain no distinguishable similarity;
and as this difference is not systematic,
it is the more difficult to acquire. No
Englishman reads Scotch with fluency, unless
he has long resided in the country—I
have looked into the poems of Burns,
which are very famous, and found them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
almost wholly unintelligible; a new dictionary
and new grammar were wanted,
and on enquiring for such I found that
none were in existence.</p>

<p>The English had no good prose writers
till the commencement of the last century,
indeed with a very few exceptions till the
present reign; but no book now can meet
with any success unless it be written in a
good style. Their rhymed poetry is less
sonorous, less euphonous, less varied, than
ours; their blank verse, on the other hand,
infinitely more rhythmical than the <i>verso
suelto</i>. But their language is incapable
of any thing between the two; they have
no <i>asonantes</i>, nor would the English ear
be delicate enough to feel them. In printing
poetry they always begin the line with
a capital letter, whether the sentence requires
it or not: this, which is the custom
with all nations except our own, though at
the expense of all propriety, certainly
gives a sort of architectural uniformity to
the page. No mark of interrogation or admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
is ever prefixed; this they might
advantageously borrow from us. A remarkable
peculiarity is, that they always write
the personal pronoun I with a capital letter.
May we not consider this great I as an
unintended proof how much an Englishman
thinks of his own consequence?</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">T</span><span class="smc">he</span>
last day of my abode in London was
the most painful of my life. To part from
dear friends, even for a transitory absence,
is among the evils of life; but to leave
them with a certainty of never meeting
again, was a grief which I had never till
now endured. Sixteen months had I been
domesticated with J., as if I had been a
brother of the family. When the children,
as they went to bed last night, came to kiss
me for the last time, I wished I had never
seen them, and all night I remained wakeful—not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
in that state of feverish startlishness
which the expectation of an early call
occasions, but in melancholy thoughts and
unavailing regret, which all the recollections
of my own country, and my father's
house, could not dissipate. Never shall I
remember my friends in England without
gratitude and love.</p>

<p>The coach was to start at five. I was
ready at four, expecting the porter from
the inn. To my surprise, rather than satisfaction,
Mrs J. and her husband had
risen, and prepared chocolate for me. The
preparations for a departure are always
mournful: even animals know and dislike
them: the dog is uneasy when he sees you
packing up, and the cat wanders disturbedly
from room to room, aware that some
change is preparing, and dreading all
change. The smell of cords and matting
becomes associated with unsettled and uneasy
feelings;—you rise by candle-light;—every
thing is unusual, unnatural, enough
to depress even joyful hope—and my departure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
was for ever. Mrs J. said, she
trusted we should meet again in a better
world, if not in this:—"Heretic as I am,"
said she, striving to force a smile through
her tears, "I am sure you will join in the
hope." Excellent woman—it cannot be
heresy to believe it.</p>

<p>For the first time I was now to travel
alone in this country: at Bristol, however,
D. was to meet me, and this was a consolation,
and a pleasure in store. We
breakfasted at Maidenhead, and then entered
upon a road which was new to me,
through a level country, with easy hills on
either side in the distance, full of villages
and villas: this was its character for fifteen
leagues. We passed through Reading,
a town of consequence in old times, and
still flourishing. Speenhamland was the
next stage, a street connected with the
town of Newbury.</p>

<p>On an eminence to the right of the town
stand the remains of Donnington castle,
built by Geoffrey Chaucer, the father of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
English poetry, who was contemporary
with king Don Juan I. We passed through
Hungerford, and through Marlborough
forest, the only one which I have seen in
England; then came to the town of the
same name, an old place, in which many
of the houses are faced with tiles in the
shape of fish-scales. At the end of the
town is one of the largest inns in the kingdom,
the house having formerly been a
duke's palace, with an artificial mound of
remarkable size in the garden.</p>

<p>There is something as peculiar as it is
pleasing in the character of this country:
the villages, with their churches, are all
seated in the bottom, which is intersected
by numberless little streams, in every respect
unlike the mountain rivers of the
north, but still beautiful; they flow slowly
over weedy beds, sometimes through banks
of oziers, sometimes through green fields.
Beyond, and on both hands, lie the Downs,
and patches of brown stubble show the
advance of cultivation up their sides; for,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
wherever there are neither hedges nor trees,
it is a certain mark that the land has not
long been cultured. The soil is chalky.
The stage stopped at a little, clean, low alehouse,
and the coachman opened the door
and asked if we would please to alight.
"By all means," said one of my fellow-travellers;
and then, addressing himself to
me, he said, "If you have ever travelled
this road before, sir, you will alight of
course; and if you have not, you must
not pass by without tasting the best beer
in England." When I had done so, I
fairly confessed to him that if I had left
England without tasting it, I should not
have known what beer was. The good
woman was so well pleased with this praise
from a foreigner, that she invited me to
walk into the cellar, and, in a room on the
same floor with the kitchen into which we
were introduced, (there being no other
apartment for us,) she showed me fifty
barrels of beer, that quantity being always
kept full. I wrote down the name of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
village, which is West Kennet, in my tablets,
that I might mention it with due honour;
and also, that if ever I should graduate
in art magic in the caves of Salamanca,
I might give the imp in attendance
a right direction where to go fill my glass
every day at dinner.</p>

<p>Near this village, and close by the road
side, is the largest tumulus in the island.
As we crossed the Downs, we saw on our
left the figure of a huge white horse cut in
the side of the chalk hill, so large, and in
such a situation, that in a clear day it is
visible above four leagues off. There are
other such in different parts of the country,
and all are regularly weeded on a holiday
appointed in each parish for the purpose.
It is perhaps a relic of Saxon superstition.
I may here notice a remarkable use which
the English make of the word <i>horse</i>. They
employ it in combination to signify any
thing large and coarse, as in horse-beans,
horse-chesnut, horse-radish;—sometimes
it is prefixed to a man's name as an epithet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
of ridicule: they say also horse-ant, and
horse-leech: and, by a still stronger compound,
I have heard a woman of masculine
appearance called a horse godmother.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span>
Dog is used still more strangely in almost
every possible sense: the wild rose is called
dog-rose; the scentless violet, dog-violet.
Jolly dog is the highest convivial
encomium which a man can receive from
his companions; honest dog is when he
superadds some good qualities to conviviality;
sad dog is when he is a reprobate:
dog is the word of endearment which an
Englishman uses to his child, and it is
what he calls his servant when he is angry:
puppy is the term of contempt for a coxcomb;
and bitch the worst appellation
which can be applied to the worst of women.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
A flatterer is called a spaniel, a ruffian
is called a bull-dog, an ill-looking fellow
an ugly hound; whelp, cur, and
mongrel, are terms of contemptuous reproach
to a young man; and if a young
woman's nose turns upward, she is certainly
called pug.</p>

<p>Having passed through the towns of
Calne and Chippenham, the light failed
us, and thus deprived me of the sight, as I
was told, of a beautiful country. About
nine we entered Bath. My fellow-travellers
all left me, and I was landed at a good
inn, for the first time without a companion,
and never more in need of one. I
have been writing with a heavy heart, lest
my heart should be heavier, were I unemployed.
Wherever we go we leave something
behind us to regret, and these causes
of sorrow are continually arising. Even
the best blessings of life are alloyed by
some feeling of separation: the bride
leaves her father's house, when she goes
to her husband's; and the anxieties of infancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
are hardly overpast, when the child
goes from his mother to commence his career
of labour and of pain. It is assuredly
delightful to have travelled, but not to
travel:—Oh, no! Fatigue, and the sense
of restlessness, are not all that is to be endured;—the
feeling that you are a stranger
and alone comes upon you in a gloomy
day, when the spirits fall with the barometer,
or when they are exhausted at evening
or at night. We paint angels with
wings, and fancy that it will be part of
our privileges in heaven to move from
place to place with accelerated speed. It
would be more reasonable to suppose that
Satan keeps stage-coaches, and has packets
upon the Styx; that locomotion ceases
when we become perfect, and beatified man
either strikes root like a zoophyte, or is
identified with his house like a tortoise.</p>

<p>If other cities are interesting as being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
old, Bath is not less so for being new. It
has no aqueduct, no palaces, no gates,
castle, or city walls, yet it is the finest and
most striking town that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>According to the fabulous History of
England, the virtues of the hot springs
here were discovered long before the
Christian æra, by Bladud, a British prince,
who, having been driven from his father's
house because he was leprous, was reduced
like the Prodigal Son to keep swine.
His pigs, says the story, had the same disease
as himself: in their wanderings they
came to this valley, and rolled in the warm
mud where these waters stagnated;—they
were healed by them. Bladud, perceiving
their cure, tried the same remedy with the
same success, and when he became king he
built a city upon the spot. It is certain
that the Romans were acquainted with these
springs, and had a station here; and it
must have been a place of some consequence
some centuries ago when the cathedral
was built, yet not of much, or the diocese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
would not, at the time of the schism, have
been united under one bishop with that of
Wells. Within the memory of old persons,
Bath consisted of a few narrow streets
in the bottom:—invalids came at that time
for the benefit of its waters; and wherever
there are such places of resort, many, who
have no real complaints, will either fancy
or feign them, for the sake of going there
to meet company. As the wealth of the
country increased, and habits of dissipation
with it, these visitors became more numerous,
and accommodations were wanting
for them.</p>

<p>Close to the town, between the springs
and the river, was a morass. The ground
belonged to Ralph Allen, the Allworthy in
Tom Jones, one of the few English works
which we have naturalized in our language.
This excellent man was of low
parentage, and had in his youth been employed
in carrying letters from a post town
across the country, for there was at that
time no regular communication from one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
town to another, except along the direct
road to London. During these solitary
journeys the thought occurred to him that
it would be far better that such a communication
should be regularly established
by the state, than that it should be left to
poor individuals like himself, who were
neither always to be found, nor always to
be trusted: accordingly, he shaped a plan
for this purpose; government adopted it;
and, in consequence, his fortune was made.
He fixed his residence on a hill about half
an hour's walk from Bath, and, carrying
with him into retirement the same active
mind which had been the means of his advancement
from obscurity, willingly listened
to any plan which could be devised for
the improvement of the city. There was
then in the city an architect of real genius,
by name Wood; and upon this morass of
Mr Allen's he erected two rows of houses,
one fronting the north, the other the
south; connected them by two transverse
streets, of which the houses were built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
upon the same plan; and left in front a
magnificent paved terrace, about thirty
paces in breadth, raised upon arches, and
open to the country. The houses were designed
for lodgers; they are large and lofty,
and are certainly the finest range of
private buildings in the whole kingdom,
and, perhaps, in the whole world.</p>

<p>About the same time a townsman, who
had amassed some fortune in trade, built
a theatre just of that size in which the
voice could be heard in all parts of the
house without being strained, and the
movements of the countenance seen without
being distorted. While the town was
thus improved by the enterprising liberality
of its inhabitants, it derived no less advantage
from the humour of one of those men
who are contented to exhibit strong sense,
in playing the fool well all the days of their
lives. By this time more persons visited
Bath in search of pleasure than of health,
and these persons, among other amusements,
had their public dances.—Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
though Englishmen have proved that they
can go on peaceably, orderly, and well,
under a free government, it was found utterly
impossible to keep English women
in order by any thing short of an absolute
monarchy. Precedency, in these public
meetings, was furiously contested,—because,
in most instances, there was no criterion
of rank whereby it could be decided;
and points which are most doubtful,
and, it may be added, most insignificant,
are oftentimes the most warmly disputed:
a perpetual Dictator for the realm of
Fashion was necessary, and this person
was the second who held the office. Nash
was his name, and his fitness for the office
is attested by the title of Beau, which is
always prefixed to it;—Charlemagne, the
Venerable Bede, and Beau Nash, being
the only three persons whose names are
always accompanied with the epithets
which characterize them.</p>

<p>Beau Nash was as great as Charlemagne
in his way, and in this respect greater,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
that the system which he established became
permanent, and he transmitted an
empire to his successors which has become
yearly more and more extensive. He made
laws to regulate when the company should
assemble, and when they should separate;
arranged the tactics of the dance; enacted
the dress in which ladies should appear;
and, if they ventured to disobey and come
in without the wedding garment, made no
scruple, whatever might be their rank, of
turning them out. His strong sense and
sarcastic humour kept them in awe. Such
a man would in old times have been selected
for the king's fool; he seems to have
considered himself as standing in some such
capacity to the Bath visitors, and made use
of the privilege which the character allowed
him. The follies of mankind were his food.
He gambled, and his profits were such as
enabled him to live expensively, and keep
an equipage and a large retinue. This life
terminated in its natural and righteous
way. He became old and helpless, lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
to stand in need of that charity which he
had never withheld from the needy, but
which none extended to him, and died
poor, neglected, and miserable; the inhabitants
of Bath rewarding his genius after
the usual manner in which genius of a
higher character is rewarded, by erecting
a statue to the honour of the man whom
they had suffered almost to starve.</p>

<p>Once, after his death, his loss was exemplified
in a very remarkable manner. Two
ladies of quality quarrelled in the ballroom.
The rest of the company took part,
some on one side, some on the other; Beau
Nash was gone, and they stood in no awe
of his successor: they became outrageous,
a real battle-royal took place, and the floor
was strewn with caps, lappets, curls and
cushions, diamond pins and pearls.</p>

<p>Since the Parades were built every addition
to the town has been made upon system,
and with a view to its beauty: hence
it presents the singular spectacle of a city
of which the parts are uniform, yet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
whole irregular;—a few old streets still remaining
to make the others more remarkable
by contrast. The adjoining hills supply
a soft freestone, which is easily worked,
and becomes harder when exposed to the
air: its colour is very beautiful when fresh,
but it is soon blackened by the soot from
the earth-coal fires, which is indeed exceedingly
annoying in all the large towns.
Still, blackened stones produce a far better
effect than blackened bricks. There is a
Square of which the sides resemble so
many palaces; ascend a handsome street
from this, and you come into a Circus of
like beauty, and near this is a Crescent
built with equal, or even more magnificence,
and overlooking the country.
There are three of these crescents on the
hills; one of them remains unfinished,
because the ground in front has not been
well secured, but in situation it is the
finest of the three. A fourth in the valley
remains one of the melancholy new
ruins, which the projectors were unable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
to complete, and so were ruined themselves,
a sudden check having been given to all
such speculations when the last war broke
out. It is plain that Bath has outgrown
its beauty. Long suburbs extend
now on every side of the city, and the
meads on the opposite side of the river,
which, when the Parades were built, justified
the motto upon one of the houses,
<i>Rus in Urbe</i>, are now covered with another
town. It must have been in its
perfection when there was nothing beyond
the new bridge nor above the old
Crescent.</p>

<p>I passed the whole morning in perambulating
the town, seeing it in all its parts.
The cathedral is small but beautiful; it
has suffered much from the fanatics. The
Pump-room is a handsome building, and
hears above the entrance the words of Pindar,
[Greek: Ariston men hydôr], here used in a sense
concerning which there can be no dispute.
I found my way into the market, which for
its excellent order and abundance surpasses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
any thing in London, and is as
surprising a sight as any in the place.
There being in some places no carriage
road, and in others so wide a pavement
that in wet weather there would be no
getting at the carriage, sedan chairs are
used instead. They are very numerous,
and with the chairmen, who all wear large
coats of dark blue, form another distinguishing
peculiarity of this remarkable
town. There are two public ball-rooms,
and two masters of the ceremonies, Beau
Nash's empire having been divided, because
it was grown too large for the superintendance
of any individual: these rooms are
handsome, and lighted with splendid chandeliers
of cut glass, but they want that light
ornamental festive character which southern
taste would have given them. Some sober
Englishmen in the anti-chambers were
silently busied at whist, though it was noon-day,—some
of them, it seems, make it the
study of their lives, and others their trade.
It is a fine place for gamblers, and for that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
species of men called fortune-hunters, a
race of swindlers of the worst kind, who
are happily unknown in Spain. They
make it their business to get a wife of fortune,
having none themselves: age, ugliness,
and even idiocy, being no objections.
They usually come from Ireland, and behave
as ill to the women whom they have
trepanned, after marriage, as the women
deserve for trusting them. It is also the
Canaan of Physicians; for it abounds with
wealthy patients, many of whom will have
any disease which the doctor will be
pleased to find out for them: but even
Canaan may be overstocked, and, it seems,
more of Death's advanced guard have
assembled here than can find milk and
honey.</p>

<p>The enormous joints of meat which
come to an English table are always roasted
upon a spit as long as the old two-handed
sword;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span> these spits are now turned by a
wheel in the chimney which the smoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
sets in motion, but formerly by the labour
of a dog who was trained to run in a wheel.
There was a peculiar breed for the purpose,
called turnspits from their occupation,
long-backed and short-legged; they are
now nearly extinct. The mode of teaching
them their business was more summary
than humane: the dog was put in the
wheel, and a burning coal with him; he
could not stop without burning his legs,
and so was kept upon the full gallop.
These dogs were by no means fond of their
profession; it was indeed hard work to run
in a wheel for two or three hours, turning
a piece of meat which was twice their own
weight. Some years ago a party of young
men at Bath hired the chairmen on a Saturday
night to steal all the turnspits in
town, and lock them up till the following
evening. Accordingly on Sunday, when
every body has roast meat for dinner, all
the cooks were to be seen in the streets,—"Pray
have you seen our Chloe?" says
one. "Why," replies the other, "I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
coming to ask you if you had seen our
Pompey:" up came a third, while they
were talking, to enquire for her Toby,—and
there was no roast meat in Bath that
day.</p>

<p>It is told of these dogs in this city, that
one Sunday, when they had as usual followed
their mistresses to church, the lesson
for the day happened to be that chapter
in Ezekiel, wherein the self-moving
chariots are described. When first the
word wheel was pronounced, all the curs
pricked up their ears in alarm; at the
second wheel they set up a doleful howl;
and when the dreaded word was uttered a
third time, every one of them scampered
out of church as fast as he could, with his
tail between his legs.</p>

<p class="gist"><i>Road from Bath to Bristol.—Cornu-Ammonis.—Bristol.—Exchange.—Market.—Cathedral.—The
Brazen Eagle.—Clifton.—Bristol-Wells.—Anecdote of
Kosciusko.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">F</span><span class="smc">rom</span>
Bath to Bristol is three leagues;
the road crosses the river Avon by an old
bridge, and continues for some way along
its banks, or at little distance from them.
Half a league from Bath is the house
wherein Fielding is said to have written
Tom Jones; it stands by the way side, in
a village called Twyverton, and I did not
look at it without respect. We had a fine
view of the river winding under a hill which
is covered with old trees, and has a mansion
on its brow, opposite to which, on our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
side the water, was the largest and finest
meadow I have seen in England, in which
an immense herd was feeding, as in a savannah.
A little dirty town, called Keynsham,
stands about half way. I noticed
the Cornu-Ammonis built up in the walls
of many of the houses, or, if it happened
to be a fine specimen, placed over the
door-way, as an ornament. This, I find,
has given rise to a fabulous legend, which
says that St Keyna, from whom the place
takes its name, resided here in a solitary
wood full of venomous serpents, and her
prayers converted them into these stones,
which still retain their shape. Beyond
this there is a fantastic building, more like
a castle than any thing else: I could neither
guess for what it was intended, nor of
what it was built. It proved to be the
stables belonging to a great house on the
opposite side of the road, from which there
is a subterranean passage, and the materials
were the scoria from some neighbouring
iron-works, with which I soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
perceived that the walls by the road side
were capt: for this it is excellently adapted,
as nothing will vegetate upon it, and it
is undecomposable by the weather. Here
we once more approached the river, which
was now a dirty stream, flowing through
wide banks of mud. Bristol was presently
in sight,—a huge city in the bottom, and
extending up all the adjoining hills, with
many steeples, one of which inclines so
much from the perpendicular, that I should
be sorry to live within reach of its fall,—and
the black towers of many glass-houses
rolling up black smoke. We entered
through a gate of modern and mean architecture
into a street which displayed as
much filth, and as much poverty, as I
have seen in any English town. Here, for
the first time, I saw something like a public
fountain, with a painted statue of Neptune
above it, which is as little creditable to the
decency of the magistrates as to the state
of arts in the city. The entrance into
Bristol is, however, the worst part of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
We crossed the bridge, where there is a
fine opening, and full in view a modern
church and spire, so beautifully proportioned,
and therefore so fine, that you do
not at first perceive that the whole building
is perfectly plain and unornamented.</p>

<p>D. was awaiting my arrival. He had secured
our places for Exeter in to-morrow's
coach, and I lost no time in seeing what
he, as being acquainted with the place,
thought most worthy to be seen. The
exchange, a fine edifice, about half a century
old, was opposite to the inn-door at
which the stage had stopped: its inclosed
square is exceedingly beautiful, more so
than any thing of the kind which I have
seen elsewhere:—yet, it seems, the citizens
choose to assemble in the street, in front,
where some friend to the city, in old times,
erected four brazen tables, on which his
town's-folk might count out their money
in their public dealings. On one of these
a man was selling newspapers, on another
a cage of goldfinches was exposed to sale.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
Behind the exchange is the market, which
is even finer than that of Bath. It contains
three market-houses, to which cheese,
butter, pork, poultry, &amp;c. are brought by
women from the country. The shambles
stand in another part; and another is appropriated
for vegetables, secured from the
weather by a range of slated sheds. I never
saw, even at a fair, a busier or more
crowded scene, and every thing was going
on with that order and dispatch which
characterize this extraordinary nation.</p>

<p>We crossed a wooden draw-bridge over
the bed of a river, where the ships were
lying on a bed of mud, and the water was
not wider than a common street gutter: it
was full of small craft; the view on one
side extended down the river into the country:
there was the bustle of business along
the quays and in the streets; one church
tower of singular beauty was in sight, and
the whole scene was fine and rememberable.
The cathedral stands in a place with
old trees in front; it is a poor building,—excepting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
Chester, the least interesting in
England. The entrance is disfigured by a
door-way in the very worst style of modern
architecture. A fine cross, which formerly
stood in the square, has been sold by the
corporation to a gentleman, who has re-erected
it at his country-seat, and thus
rescued it from destruction! This was
about thirty years ago; the person who
told me this, said he did not remember it,
but had often in his childhood eaten it in
gingerbread. Instead of ascending, you
descend into this church, by several steps;
the pavement is therefore necessarily damp,
and, what is truly abominable, stinks of
the abominations which are, in contempt
of all decency, committed against the
doors, and find their way down.</p>

<p>It is, as I have elsewhere mentioned, a
part of the service of the English Church
to read a portion of the Scriptures, one
chapter from the Old Testament, and another
from the New. In common parochial
churches, the whole of the service is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
performed by the officiating priest, and he
does this in his desk: but, in cathedrals,
one of the minor priests takes this part of
the duty, and performs it in the middle of
the choir: here the bible is usually placed
upon the outspread wings of a brazen
eagle, the handsomest of all their church
ornaments. Such an eagle they had in
this cathedral, and a remarkably handsome
one it was; but last year the dean and
chapter thought proper to sell it, for the
sake of applying the paltry sum which it
would produce as old brass in ornaments
for the altar.—So the eagle went as the
cross had gone before it. There happened
to be a man in the city whose humour it
is to attend service whenever it is performed
in this cathedral: on week days
this is considered by the priests as a mere
matter of form; and having few or none to
attend them, they omit parts of the liturgy,
and hurry over the rest, to get through
their task as speedily as possible. During
many years it had been the main business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
of this person to watch them, and endeavour
to bring them to a sense of their duty;
for which purpose he wrote to them whenever
he found them offending, and also to
the dean and to the bishop, calling upon
them to interfere, and see that the service
of the church was duly performed. He missed
the eagle, enquired for it, traced it to
the brazier's, and rescued it from the furnace.
Here was a fine subject for his
zeal! He wrote a circular letter to all the
bishops, of which they took no notice;
offered the eagle again to the cathedral at
the price which he had paid for it, which
they refused, being, as might have been
expected, obstinate in their misconduct—and,
lastly, put it up to sale,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span> in the hope
that it might be purchased for some other
church, and not utterly desecrated. What
has been its fate I know not; but it seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
that the respect which the English pay to
their cathedrals is confined to the buildings,
and does not extend to any thing in them.
At one time all the monumental figures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
and inscriptions were cut in brass:—a large
collection of these, which were taken up
from another cathedral while it was repaired,
have gone the way of the eagle,
and been cast into candlesticks and warming-pans.</p>

<p>The monuments in the church are numerous;
that nearest the entrance is the
finest and the most remarkable, as being
Mrs Draper's, the Eliza of Sterne and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
the Abbé Raynal. The rhapsody about
her, in the latter's work, is as excellent a
specimen of every thing that is absurd, as
it would be easy to find even in his Histoire
Philosophique. Some parts of the architecture
are beautiful in their kind. At
a little distance from the church is a Saxon
gateway: the upper part is in admirable
preservation—the bottom has been corroded
by a practice as indecent as it is sacrilegious—the
more to be regretted, as
this is one of the finest specimens of the
style.</p>

<p>The views in the neighbourhood of this
city are singularly pleasing. The adjoining
village of Clifton was once the most
beautiful village in England, and may
now be said to be the finest suburb. Here
too, as well as at Bath, is the dismal sight
of streets and crescents which have never
been finished, the most dolorous of all
ruins. It stands upon a hill above the
river, which runs between high rocks and
a hanging wood; a scene truly magnificent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
and wanting nothing but clearer
water; the stream consists of liquid mud,
and the banks are hideous unless the tide
be full, for the tide rises here not less than
forty English feet. The beauty of this
scene is yearly diminishing; the rocks
which formerly rose so immediately from
the river side, as only to allow room for
a path, are used as quarries. The people
of Bristol seem to sell every thing that can
be sold. They sold their cross,—by what
species of weight or measurement I know
not,—they sold their eagle by the pound,
and here they are selling the sublime and
beautiful by the boat-load! One grand
crag which has been left untouched shows
what mischief has already been done.
There is a cavern near the summit of this,
of which the arch appeared remarkably
fine as we looked up to it from the side of
the river.</p>

<p>I tasted their famous medicinal water
which rises at the foot of these rocks; it
is tepid, and so completely without any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
medicinal flavour, as to be excellent water.
In cases of diabetes it possesses some virtue;
for consumption, which it is usually
prescribed for, none whatsoever. Several
unhappy patients, who had been sent here
to die at a distance from home, were crawling
out upon the parade as if to take their
last gasp of sunshine. It was shocking to
see them, and it is shocking to hear how
thoroughly the people here regard death as
a matter of trade. The same persons who
keep the hotels furnish the funerals; entertain
patients while they are living, and
then, that they may accommodate them
all through, bury them when they die.
There came here a young man from the
North, dying, with his sister to attend him.
The disease sometimes, when it assumes
its gentlest form, seems to terminate suddenly;
and one morning, when the sister
rose to breakfast and enquired for him, she
found he was dead. He had expired during
the night; the people of the house
said they thought they might as well not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
disturb her, so they had laid out the body,
dressed it in the shroud, measured it for the
coffin, and given all the orders—to take
all trouble off her hands. You will think
it scarcely possible that this scene of disease
and death should be a place of amusement,
where idlers of fashion resort to
spend the summer, mingle in the pump-room
and in the walks with the dying, and
have their card-parties and dances within
hearing of every passing bell.</p>

<p>Half a century ago Bristol was in size
the second city in England. Manchester
now holds that rank, and several other
towns have outstripped it in population.
There is less mercantile enterprise here
than in any other trading English city: like
the old Italians, the Bristol merchants go
on in the track of their fathers, and, succeeding
to enormous fortunes, find the regular
profits so great that they have no
temptation to deviate from the beaten way.
The port is therefore yielding its foreign
trade to bolder competitors; but it will always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
remain the centre of a great commerce
with the Welsh coast, with Ireland,
and all those inland counties which communicate
with the Severn, a river navigable
into the very heart of the kingdom.</p>

<p>There is in the streets nothing like the
bustle of London, nor like the business of
Liverpool on the quays. The quay, however,
is still a busy as well as a striking
scene, and remains a noble monument of
the old citizens, who made it in the thirteenth
century. On one side, the shipping,
the bridges, the church-towers, and the
neighbouring hill, which overlooks the
town of which it now makes a part, form
a fine picture; on the other, there is the
cathedral with the old trees in its front, and
the distant country. A third view has a
wider foreground, with cranes and trees,
and piles of goods intermingled, shipping
of larger size, a fine row of houses upon
a high terrace on the opposite side, and
apart from them the church of St Mary
Redclift, which is the finest parochial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
church in the kingdom, and is indeed far
more beautiful than the cathedral. It is
remarkable also, on this account, that it is
the place wherein certain poems were said
to have been found, attributed to a priest
in the fifteenth century, which have occasioned
as great a controversy as the Granada
Relicks, and with as little reason. It
is now admitted that they were the production
of Chatterton, the son of the sexton
of the church, who poisoned himself
at the age of eighteen, and is considered
by the English as the most extraordinary
genius that has ever appeared among
them.</p>

<p>A few years ago, when Kosciusko came
to this city on his way to America,
great marks of honour were shown him,
and many presents made him, both by
the municipality, and by individuals.—Among
others, an honest gingerbread-baker
thought, as he was going to sea, nothing
could be more acceptable to him than a
noble plum-cake for the voyage: he made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
him the very best which could be made,
and a valiant one it was. It was as big
as he could carry; and on the top, which
was as usual covered with a crust of sugar,
was written in coloured sugar-plums—To
the gallant Kosciusko. With this burthen
the good man proceeded to the house of
the American consul, where Kosciusko was
lodged, and enquired for the general. He
was told that he was lying on the sofa (for
his wounds were not at that time healed,)
and was too much fatigued and too unwell
to see any one. "Oh!" said the gingerbread-baker,
"he won't be angry at seeing
me, I warrant, so show me the way up;"
and pushing the servant forward, he followed
him up stairs into the room. When
however he saw the great man whom he
was come to honour, lying on a couch,
with his countenance pale, painful, and
emaciated, yet full of benevolence, the
sight overpowered him; he put down his
cake, burst into tears like a child, and ran
out of the room without speaking a single
word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
Having set out on my return, a natural
impatience hurries me forward; I should
else regret that I have not procured letters
to Bristol, and allowed myself sufficient
time to see thoroughly a city which contains
many interesting objects of curiosity,
and of which the vicinity is so exceedingly
beautiful.</p>

As the notice for this sale is not less curious than
the occasion, I have transcribed it from the city newspaper.
One of the many conveniences attending the
English coffee-houses is, that the newspapers are regularly
filed in them, so that they may always be referred
to:—</p>

<p class="nodent">This elegant piece of workmanship was sold, last
June, by the dean and chapter of the cathedral
church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Bristol,
or their agents or servants, as old brass, and weighed
6 cwt. 20lb. or 692lb. and has since been purchased
at an advanced price, by a native of this city, in order
to prevent it being broken up, and to give the inhabitants
a chance of buying it.</p>

<p class="nodent">It was given to the cathedral, in the reign of Charles
II. by one of the prebendaries, who had been there
40 years; and is supposed, by the following Latin inscription,
(<i>which was engraved</i> on the pillar or pedestal,)
to have stood in the choir 119 years:</p>

<p class="nodent">"Ex Dono Georgij Williamson, S. T. B. Hujus
Ecclesiæ Cathedralis Bristoll: Vice-Decani, 1683."</p>

<p class="nodent">That is,</p>

<p class="nodent">"The Gift of George Williamson, Bachelor of
Divinity, Sub-Dean of this Cathedral Church of Bristol,
1683."</p>

<p class="nodent">The whole of the inscription, except the figures
1683, has been taken off the pedestal, without the
consent of the buyer; which he has since had re-engraved.</p>

<p class="nodent">This piece of antiquity, which is of the most exquisite
shape, is made of the best and purest brass,
and well worth the attention of <i>ministers and churchwardens</i>,
or any gentleman or lady who would wish to
make a present of it to their parish church: traders,
also, to foreign parts, may find it worth their while
to purchase, <i>as a like opportunity may never offer
again</i>.</p>

<p class="nodent">Such a handsome bird would be, as it has hitherto
been, a very great ornament to the middle aisle of a
church. It for many years stood in the choir of the
Bristol cathedral, and <i>upheld with its wings the Sacred
Truths of the Blessed Gospel</i>. The minor-canons
formerly read the lessons on it, and in most cathedrals
the custom is kept up to this day.</p>

<p class="nodent">This superb image is <i>now</i> at King-street Hall,
and may be inspected three days previous to the day
of sale.</p>

<p class="nodent">N. B. The purchaser offered, previous to any advertisement,
to re-sell the eagle at the price he paid
for it, provided it were replaced in the <i>choir</i>; which
offer was rejected.</p>

took our seats on the coach roof at
five in the morning, and before we got out
of the city received positive and painful
proof that the streets of Bristol are worse
paved than those of any other city in England.
The road passes by the church of
St Mary Redclift, which is indeed wonderfully
fine; it is built upon broken ground,
and there are steps ascending to it in several
directions. I remember nothing equal
to the effect which this produces. Women
were filling their pitchers below it from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
fountain, the water of which passes through
the cemetery!—The houses formed a continued
street for nearly half a league; then
the views became very striking: behind us
was the city, on one side the rocks of Clifton,
and as we advanced, we came in sight
of the Bristol Channel. We breakfasted
five leagues on the way at Cross, a little
village of inns; and then entered upon the
marshes, the great grazing country of these
parts.</p>

<p>Our next stage was to Bridgewater,
where we crossed the Parrot by a hideous
iron bridge. This river is remarkable, because
the tide, instead of rising gradually,
flows in in a head,—a phænomenon of
which no satisfactory explanation has yet
been discovered. From hence we proceeded
to Taunton through a tract of country
which for its fertility and beauty is the
boast of the island. "Ah, sir," said a
countryman who was on the coach beside
us, and heard us admiring it, "we have
a saying about these western parts,</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">"Cornwall's as ugly as ugly can be;</div>
<div class="verse">Devonshire's better certainly;</div>
<div class="verse">But Somersetshire is the best of the three,</div>
<div class="verse">And Somersetshire is the country for me."</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Taunton is a singularly pretty town,
with a church of uncommon beauty. It
was the great scene of cruelty after Monmouth's
insurrection against his uncle
James II., the greater number of the insurgents
being of this county. One of the prisoners
who was noted for being fleet of
foot, was promised his life, if he would entertain
Kirke the general with a display of
his speed. He stripped himself naked; one
end of a rope was fastened round his neck,
the other round the neck of a horse, and
they ran half a mile together, the horse going
full speed. When the general had
been sufficiently amused, and had gratified
his curiosity, he sent the man to be hanged.
Judge Jefferies, whose name is become proverbially
infamous, went round to finish
his work, and condemn all whom the
soldiers had spared. The rebel peasantry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
were hanged up by scores, their quarters
boiled in pitch, and set up in the streets
and highways. James would not perhaps
so easily have lost his crown, if he had not
alienated the hearts of the people by these
merciless executions. Kirke escaped all
other earthly punishment than that of having
his name handed down from father to
son for everlasting execration, by abandoning
the master whom he had served
so wickedly, and joining William. The
judge received a part of his reward in this
world: after the flight of the king, he attempted
to escape in sailor's clothes, and
the mob discovered him. They were prevented
from pulling him to pieces upon the
spot, but before he was rescued they had
so handled him that he just lived to be
three days in dying. Popular fury has,
like lightning, more frequently struck the
innocent than the guilty; but when it does
strike the guilty it comes like lightning, as
God's own vengeance, and leaves behind
a more holy and wholesome awe, than any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
legal execution, how solemn soever it be
made.</p>

<p>After dinner we advanced a league and
half to Wellington, where I saw a fine lad
who had lost both legs by the frost in
1798,—a melancholy proof of the severity
of the climate, even in the mildest part of
England. Collumpton, a poorer and smaller
town, is three leagues farther, and another
stage of the same length brought me
once more to Exeter.</p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<p>Whoever has once travelled the straight
road from Exeter to Falmouth will have
no inclination to travel it again. Plymouth
lay about ten leagues out of the way, and
it would always have been a subject of regret
to me if I had not now lengthened
my journey for the sake of seeing so famous
a place. The stage was full: luckily
a naval officer was enquiring for a place at
the same time, so we took chaise together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
Chudleigh was the first stage: about
three hundred French prisoners were
crowded here into a temporary prison,
on their way to Bristol. We saw them
looking through some wooden bars at
what was passing. Ashburton the next.
Devonshire is certainly a fine country,
but by no means deserving of the encomiums
which are passed upon it; those
travellers who praise it so highly must
either have come from Cornwall, or have
slept through Somersetshire. Its rivers
indeed are beautiful, clear, vocal, stony
streams, with old bridges dangerously narrow,
and angles in them, like the corners
of an English mince-pie, for the foot-passenger
to take shelter in. From Ashburton
we reached Ivy Bridge by another easy
stage: this is a very celebrated spot for
its picturesque beauty, but why it should
be so would be difficult to say.—A common
little bridge, over a beautiful brook,
which runs down a little glen, on the
banks of which are town-looking houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
instead of cottages,—that kind of scene,
of which, if you had never heard of it, you
would just say it is pretty,—but which, if
it has been previously praised, cannot but
be seen with disappointment.</p>

<p>From hence to Plymouth was 11 miles,
the latter part through a beautiful country.
There are two distinct towns here, Plymouth
and Plymouth Dock, connected by
a causey, and both places as ugly as can
well be imagined. They are so called from
the river Plym, which rises in the Devonshire
hills; and, as an English author says,
baptizing Plymston and Plymstock by
the way, empties itself here into the sea.
I know not whether there be any more
interesting anecdote connected with the
neighbourhood than the story of a dog,
who daily carried food to an old blind
mastiff which lay hid in a thicket without
the town, regularly on Sundays conveyed
him to his master's house to dinner, and as
regularly afterwards escorted him back to
his covert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
I could not see the docks.—This jealousy
on the part of government I could
not blame, though it deprived me of some
gratification. The streets are swarming
with sailors. This extraordinary race of
men hold the soldiers in utter contempt,
which, with their characteristic force, they
express by this scale of comparison,—Mess-mate
before ship-mate, ship-mate
before a stranger, a stranger before a dog,
and a dog before a soldier.</p>

<p>There are however some things, as I
learnt from our fellow-traveller, in which
the army enjoy advantages which are not
extended to the navy. Wherever the soldiers
go, each regiment takes with it its
paymaster; but sailors and marines are
never paid any where except in England,
however long they may be absent. Upon
the marines this is particularly hard, as
there is a practice of drafting them out
of vessels which are going home into those
which are to remain upon the foreign station.
This is done to keep up the complement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
because no men are forced into
this, as they are into the navy service, and
no addition is made to it abroad, unless
any prisoners should enter, which the
Dutch soldiers frequently do. "I knew,"
said this officer, "a private marine who
had been nine years on a foreign station,
and never received one farthing of pay;
and he would have been drafted again into
another ship still to remain there, if the
captain had not stated to the commander-in-chief
that he was quite blind at night,
a common disease within the tropics."
This is one reason why so many men in
those seas desert from the English ships
to the American.</p>

<p>If a regiment loses its baggage, the
officers are allowed a sum for it in proportion
to their rank; and the allowance
is so liberal, that in many instances their
loss is a great gain. No such indulgence
is granted in the navy, though there is
more cause for it, the baggage of a navy-officer
being far more valuable. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
ship is his house and home; it is not
with him merely the loss of a travelling
portmanteau; he has his books, his charts,
his instruments, and his cabin furniture,
and it would require many years of economy
before these could be replaced from
the savings of his pay.</p>

<p>In another instance the English are
strangely parsimonious to their navy. Other
nations supply their men of war with
charts, made for the express purpose; but
when an English ship is ordered abroad,
it not unfrequently happens, that no good
charts of the place where it is going are
on board, and the master is obliged to buy
such as he can find, and such as he can afford.
Neither are time-pieces provided
for ships of war; though few valuable
merchantmen are without them.—This
is strange parsimony in so enlightened a
government;—assuredly it ought to provide
every thing which is necessary for
the ship's safety.</p>

<p>The organization of this tremendous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
navy is a subject of great interest to other
maritime powers. No person can receive
a commission till he has passed six years
in actual service as a midshipman, and
gone through an examination before a
board of officers in London; who certainly
reject him, if he is not well acquainted with
his duty. Of late years such prodigious glory
has been obtained in the English navy, and
such large fortunes rapidly accumulated,
that the higher classes destine their children
to this profession, which was formerly
left almost wholly to the people, and have
well nigh monopolized it. This is not
detrimental to the service in any other way
than that they are appointed to a command
at too early an age. The severe education
which is required, and never dispensed
with, makes them necessarily understand
their profession, and gives them, whatever
may have been their former habits of life,
the true sailor character. Hence it is that
they are so infinitely superior to the army
officers, who are in general ignorant of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
any thing more than the common routine
of the parade.</p>

<p>After the midshipman has passed his examination,
if he has any interest, (without
which nothing is now to be obtained in
England,) he is made lieutenant; from this
rank he may at any time be promoted to
that of commander, or of post-captain,
without the intermediate step. The post-captains
become admirals according to seniority.
This system of seniority ought to
be reversed, to hold good in the inferior
steps, and not above them. It should seem
more equitable, and more wise, that every
officer should be sure of reaching the rank
of commander, because, having passed his
youth in the service, the nation owes him
the means of a comfortable subsistence in
his age. On the other hand, admirals
should be chosen from those only of distinguished
ability.</p>

<p>Every body regrets the necessity of impressing
men for the navy. I have seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
it asserted, that when Lord Keppel was at
the head of the Admiralty, it was officially
calculated and ascertained, that every prest
man cost above 100<i>l.</i> such was the expense
of press-gangs, cutters, tenders, &amp;c. Surely,
if this statement approached even to
truth, the evil would have been remedied.</p>

<p>Voltaire has the merit of having discovered
the physical cause of the superiority
of the English at sea. The natives of the
South of Europe navigate smooth seas,—those
of the North are frozen up during
winter; but the English seas are open all
the year, and are navigated in long dark
stormy nights, when nothing but great
skill and incessant exertion can preserve
the vessel. Hence arises a degree of confidence
in their sailors, which is almost
incredible; the greater the danger, the
greater is their activity: instead of shrinking
from toil, every man is at his post;—having
no faith in miracles for their deliverance,
they almost work miracles to deliver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
themselves, and, instead of preparing
for death, strain every sinew to avoid
it. Added to this confidence, they have
also in war that which arises from constant
success. The English sailor feels that he
is master of the seas. Whatever he sees
is to do him homage. He is always on the
look-out, not with the fear of an enemy before
his eyes, but, like a strong pirate, with
the hope of gain; and when going into
action, with an equal, or even a superior
force, he calculates his profits as certainly
as if the enemy were already taken.—"There,"
said the master of a frigate,
when the captain did not choose to engage
a superior French force, because he had a
convoy in charge—"There," said he with
a groan, "there's seven hundred pounds
lost to me for ever."—As for fear, it is not
in their nature. One of these men went to
see a juggler exhibit his tricks: there happened
to be a quantity of gunpowder in
the apartment underneath, which took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
fire and blew up the house. The sailor
was thrown into a garden behind, where
he fell without being hurt—He stretched
his arms and legs, got up, shook himself,
rubbed his eyes, and then cried out,—conceiving
what had happened to be only a
part of the performance, and perfectly
willing to go through the whole,—"D—n
the fellow, I wonder what the devil he'll
do next!"</p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<p>A slow and uncomfortable stage-coach
carried us from Tor-point, which is on the
western side of Plymouth harbour, to Falmouth,
through the towns of Liskeard,
Lostwithiel, a pretty place with its slated
roofs and its singular church tower, St
Austel, and Truro. We are now at the
same inn and in the same room in which
I was lodged with J. on our arrival. I had
then the delightful and stirring pleasure
of expectation; I have now a deeper joy
in the hope of soon setting foot in my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
country, and being welcomed in my father's
house. But I have left dear friends
whom I shall never behold again, and am
departing from a land in which I have enjoyed
as much happiness as man can possibly
enjoy in any other state than that of
domestic tranquillity.</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
